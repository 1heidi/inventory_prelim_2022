34167460,A comprehensive database for integrated analysis of omics data in autoimmune diseases.,"<h4>Background</h4>Autoimmune diseases are heterogeneous pathologies with difficult diagnosis and few therapeutic options. In the last decade, several omics studies have provided significant insights into the molecular mechanisms of these diseases. Nevertheless, data from different cohorts and pathologies are stored independently in public repositories and a unified resource is imperative to assist researchers in this field.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we present Autoimmune Diseases Explorer ( https://adex.genyo.es ), a database that integrates 82 curated transcriptomics and methylation studies covering 5609 samples for some of the most common autoimmune diseases. The database provides, in an easy-to-use environment, advanced data analysis and statistical methods for exploring omics datasets, including meta-analysis, differential expression or pathway analysis.<h4>Conclusions</h4>This is the first omics database focused on autoimmune diseases. This resource incorporates homogeneously processed data to facilitate integrative analyses among studies.","Bioinformatics Unit, GENYO.

33837660,Upregulation of ZHX2 predicts poor prognosis and is correlated with immune infiltration in gastric cancer.,"The transcriptional repressor zinc finger homeobox 2 (ZHX2) is reported to regulate tumor progression in several human cancers, although little is known about its role in gastric cancer (GC). In the present study, we investigated the expression of ZHX2 and its relationship with the clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of GC patients, and we also examined the effect of ZHX2 overexpression in GC cell lines. We used UALCAN (http://ualcan.path.uab.edu) and the Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (http://cistrome.org/TIMER) to examine ZHX2 mRNA expression, and also used Kaplan-Meier Plotter (https://kmplot.com) to determine whether ZHX2 expression was related to GC prognosis. Expression of ZHX2 protein was detected using immunohistochemical staining assays. Cell proliferation was evaluated using a cell counting kit-8 and colony formation assays, whereas apoptosis was examined by flow cytometry. Wound healing and transwell assays were used to detect cell migration and invasion. We also performed Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (https://www.gsea-msigdb.org) and used The Cancer Genome Atlas database (https://www.genome.gov/Funded-Programs-Projects/Cancer-Genome-Atlas) to examine the correlation of ZHX2 with immune infiltration. We report that ZHX2 is highly expressed in GC tissues and is significantly associated with clinical characteristics. Upregulation of ZHX2 predicted poor prognosis in GC. Furthermore, ZHX2 overexpression can promote the proliferation, invasion and migration, but inhibit apoptosis, of GC cells. High expression of ZHX2 in GC is correlated with the presence of infiltrating immune cells, including B cells, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. Our data suggest that high expression of ZHX2 in GC predicts poor prognosis. In addition, ZHX2 may promote malignant behaviors of GC cells, and immune infiltration might be related to the oncogenic role of ZHX2 in GC.","Department of Gastrointestinal Surgery, Laboratory Research Center, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, China."
34010390,Integration of 1:1 orthology maps and updated datasets into Echinobase. ,"Echinobase (https://echinobase.org) is a central online platform that generates, manages and hosts genomic data relevant to echinoderm research. While the resource primarily serves the echinoderm research community, the recent release of an excellent quality genome for the frequently studied purple sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus genome, v5.0) has provided an opportunity to adapt to the needs of a broader research community across other model systems. To this end, establishing pipelines to identify orthologous genes between echinoderms and other species has become a priority in many contexts including nomenclature, linking to data in other model organisms, and in internal functionality where data gathered in one hosted species can be associated with genes in other hosted echinoderms. This paper describes the orthology pipelines currently employed by Echinobase and how orthology data are processed to yield 1:1 ortholog mappings between a variety of echinoderms and other model taxa. We also describe functions of interest that have recently been included on the resource, including an updated developmental time course for S.purpuratus, and additional tracks for genome browsing. These data enhancements will increase the accessibility of the resource to non-echinoderm researchers and simultaneously expand the data quality and quantity available to core Echinobase users.

34309639,MUSTARD-a comprehensive resource of mutation-specific therapies in cancer. ,"The steady increase in global cancer burden has fuelled the development of several modes of treatment for the disease. In the presence of an actionable mutation, targeted therapies offer a method to selectively attack cancer cells, increasing overall efficacy and reducing harmful side effects. However, different drug molecules are in different stages of development, with new molecules obtaining approvals from regulatory agencies each year. To augment clinical impact, it is important that this information reaches clinicians, patients and researchers swiftly and in a structured, well-annotated manner. To this end, we have developed Mutation-Specific Therapies Resource and Database in Cancer (MUSTARD), a database that is designed to be a centralized resource with diverse information such as cancer subtype, associated mutations, therapy offered and its effect observed, along with links to external resources for a more comprehensive annotation. In its current version, MUSTARD comprises over 2105 unique entries, including associations between 418 unique drug therapies, 189 cancer subtypes and 167 genes curated and annotated from over 862 different publications.

33882120,APICURON: a database to credit and acknowledge the work of biocurators. ,"APICURON is an open and freely accessible resource that tracks and credits the work of biocurators across multiple participating knowledgebases. Biocuration is essential to extract knowledge from research data and make it available in a structured and standardized way to the scientific community. However, processing biological data-mainly from literature-requires a huge effort that is difficult to attribute and quantify. APICURON collects biocuration events from third-party resources and aggregates this information, spotlighting biocurator contributions. APICURON promotes biocurator engagement implementing gamification concepts like badges, medals and leaderboards and at the same time provides a monitoring service for registered resources and for biocurators themselves. APICURON adopts a data model that is flexible enough to represent and track the majority of biocuration activities. Biocurators are identified through their Open Researcher and Contributor ID. The definition of curation events, scoring systems and rules for assigning badges and medals are resource-specific and easily customizable. Registered resources can transfer curation activities on the fly through a secure and robust Application Programming Interface (API). Here, we show how simple and effective it is to connect a resource to APICURON, describing the DisProt database of intrinsically disordered proteins as a use case. We believe APICURON will provide biological knowledgebases with a service to recognize and credit the effort of their biocurators, monitor their activity and promote curator engagement.

34104972,eSkip-Finder: a machine learning-based web application and database to identify the optimal sequences of antisense oligonucleotides for exon skipping.,"Exon skipping using antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) has recently proven to be a powerful tool for mRNA splicing modulation. Several exon-skipping ASOs have been approved to treat genetic diseases worldwide. However, a significant challenge is the difficulty in selecting an optimal sequence for exon skipping. The efficacy of ASOs is often unpredictable, because of the numerous factors involved in exon skipping. To address this gap, we have developed a computational method using machine-learning algorithms that factors in many parameters as well as experimental data to design highly effective ASOs for exon skipping. eSkip-Finder (https://eskip-finder.org) is the first web-based resource for helping researchers identify effective exon skipping ASOs. eSkip-Finder features two sections: (i) a predictor of the exon skipping efficacy of novel ASOs and (ii) a database of exon skipping ASOs. The predictor facilitates rapid analysis of a given set of exon/intron sequences and ASO lengths to identify effective ASOs for exon skipping based on a machine learning model trained by experimental data. We confirmed that predictions correlated well with in vitro skipping efficacy of sequences that were not included in the training data. The database enables users to search for ASOs using queries such as gene name, species, and exon number.","HPC- and AI-driven Drug Development Platform Division, RIKEN Center for Computational Science, Yokohama 230-0045, Japan."

In comparison with the original version SorGSD, which contains SNPs from 48 sorghum accessions mapped to the reference genome BTx623 (v2.1), the new version was expanded to 289 sorghum lines with both single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small insertions/deletions (INDELs), which were aligned to the newly assembled and annotated sorghum genome BTx623 (v3.1). Moreover, phenotypic data and panicle pictures of critical accessions were provided in the new version. We implemented new tools including ID Conversion, Homologue Search and Genome Browser for analysis and updated the general information related to sorghum research, such as online sorghum resources and literature references. In addition, we deployed a new database infrastructure and redesigned a new user interface as one of the Genome Variation Map databases. The new version SorGSD is freely accessible online at http://ngdc.cncb.ac.cn/sorgsd/ .<h4>Conclusions</h4>SorGSD is a comprehensive integration with large-scale genomic variation, phenotypic information and incorporates online data analysis tools for data mining, genome navigation and analysis. We hope that SorGSD could provide a valuable resource for sorghum researchers to find variations they are interested in and generate customized high-throughput datasets for further analysis.","Key Laboratory of Plant Resources, Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100093, China."

Factors influencing the stability of MPs differ from globular proteins due to the presence of membrane spanning regions. Thermodynamic data of MPs aid to understand the relationship among their structure, stability and function. Although a wealth of experimental data on thermodynamics of MPs are reported in the literature, there is no database available explicitly for MPs. In this work, we have developed a database for MP thermodynamics, MPTherm, which contains more than 7000 thermodynamic data from about 320 MPs.

33984507,HisPhosSite: A comprehensive database of histidine phosphorylated proteins and sites.,"Histidine phosphorylation is critically important in a variety of cellular processes including signal transduction, cell cycle, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. It is estimated to account for 6% of all phosphorylated amino acids. However, due to the acid lability of the PN bond, the study of pHis lags far behind that of pSer, pThr, and pTyr. Recently, the development and use of pHis-specific antibodies and methodologies have led to a resurgence in the study of histidine phosphorylation. Although a considerable number of pHis proteins and sites have been discovered, most of them have not been manually curated and integrated to any databases. There is a lack of a data repository for pHis, and such work is expected to help further systemic studies of pHis. Thus, we present a comprehensive resource database of histidine phosphorylation (HisPhosSite) by curating experimentally validated pHis proteins and sites and compiling putative pHis sites with ortholog search. HisPhosSite contains 776 verified pHis sites and 2702 verified pHis proteins in 38 eukaryotic and prokaryotic species and 15,378 putative pHis sites and 10,816 putative pHis proteins in 1366 species. HisPhosSite provides rich annotations of pHis sites and proteins and multiple search engines (including motif search and BLAST search) for users to locate pHis sites of interest. HisPhosSite is available at http://reprod.njmu.edu.cn/hisphossite. SIGNIFICANCE: Histidine phosphorylation is involved in a variety of cellular processes as well as cancers, and it has been proved to be more common than previously thought. The HisPhosSite database was developed to collect pHis data from published literatures with experimental evidences. Unification of the identified pHis proteins and sites will give researchers an informative resource for histidine phosphorylation. HisPhosSite has a user-friendly interface with multiple search engines for users to locate pHis sites of interest. In addition, the database provides rich structural and functional annotations. HisPhosSite will help future studies and elucidation of the functions of histidine phosphorylation.","Department of Biomedical Engineering, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing 210016, China."

The data is a result of a research collaboration between the scientist from INRAE, agricultural advisers from Chamber of Agriculture of Pays de la Loire (CRAPL) and a collective of five arable and two livestock farmers located in the district of Pays de Pouzauges (Vendée department, western France). All participants formed part of the DiverIMPACTS project (https://www.diverimpacts.net/) that aims to achieve the full potential of diversification of cropping systems for improved productivity, delivery of ecosystem services and resource-efficient and sustainable value chains in Europe. The first dataset corresponds to the inputs of MAELIA (http://maelia-platform.inra.fr/), a spatial agent-based simulation platform that was used to support an iterative design and assessment of scenarios to redesign cropping systems.

33929905,Risk-Based Chemical Ranking and Generating a Prioritized Human Exposome Database.,"<h4>Background</h4>Due to the ubiquitous use of chemicals in modern society, humans are increasingly exposed to thousands of chemicals that contribute to a major portion of the human exposome. Should a comprehensive and risk-based human exposome database be created, it would be conducive to the rapid progress of human exposomics research. In addition, once a xenobiotic is biotransformed with distinct half-lives upon exposure, monitoring the parent compounds alone may not reflect the actual human exposure. To address these questions, a comprehensive and risk-prioritized human exposome database is needed.<h4>Objectives</h4>Our objective was to set up a comprehensive risk-prioritized human exposome database including physicochemical properties as well as risk prediction and develop a graphical user interface (GUI) that has the ability to conduct searches for content associated with chemicals in our database.<h4>Methods</h4>We built a comprehensive risk-prioritized human exposome database by text mining and database fusion. Subsequently, chemicals were prioritized by integrating exposure level obtained from the Systematic Empirical Evaluation of Models with toxicity data predicted by the Toxicity Estimation Software Tool and the Toxicological Priority Index calculated from the ToxCast database. The biotransformation half-lives (HLBs) of all the chemicals were assessed using the Iterative Fragment Selection approach and biotransformation products were predicted using the previously developed BioTransformer machine-learning method.<h4>Results</h4>We compiled a human exposome database of >20,000 chemicals, prioritized 13,441 chemicals based on probabilistic hazard quotient and 7,770 chemicals based on risk index, and provided a predicted biotransformation metabolite database of >95,000 metabolites. In addition, a user-interactive Java software (Oracle)-based search GUI was generated to enable open access to this new resource.<h4>Discussion</h4>Our database can be used to guide chemical management and enhance scientific understanding to rapidly and effectively prioritize chemicals for comprehensive biomonitoring in epidemiological investigations. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP7722.","School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore."

33980298,IDSM ChemWebRDF: SPARQLing small-molecule datasets.,"The Resource Description Framework (RDF), together with well-defined ontologies, significantly increases data interoperability and usability. The SPARQL query language was introduced to retrieve requested RDF data and to explore links between them. Among other useful features, SPARQL supports federated queries that combine multiple independent data source endpoints. This allows users to obtain insights that are not possible using only a single data source. Owing to all of these useful features, many biological and chemical databases present their data in RDF, and support SPARQL querying. In our project, we primary focused on PubChem, ChEMBL and ChEBI small-molecule datasets. These datasets are already being exported to RDF by their creators. However, none of them has an official and currently supported SPARQL endpoint. This omission makes it difficult to construct complex or federated queries that could access all of the datasets, thus underutilising the main advantage of the availability of RDF data. Our goal is to address this gap by integrating the datasets into one database called the Integrated Database of Small Molecules (IDSM) that will be accessible through a SPARQL endpoint. Beyond that, we will also focus on increasing mutual interoperability of the datasets. To realise the endpoint, we decided to implement an in-house developed SPARQL engine based on the PostgreSQL relational database for data storage. In our approach, data are stored in the traditional relational form, and the SPARQL engine translates incoming SPARQL queries into equivalent SQL queries. An important feature of the engine is that it optimises the resulting SQL queries. Together with optimisations performed by PostgreSQL, this allows efficient evaluations of SPARQL queries. The endpoint provides not only querying in the dataset, but also the compound substructure and similarity search supported by our Sachem project. Although the endpoint is accessible from an internet browser, it is mainly intended to be used for programmatic access by other services, for example as a part of federated queries. For regular users, we offer a rich web application called ChemWebRDF using the endpoint. The application is publicly available at https://idsm.elixir-czech.cz/chemweb/ .","Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the CAS, Flemingovo náměstí 2, 166 10, Prague 6, Czech Republic. jakub.galgonek@uochb.cas.cz."

34339812,PharmDE: A new expert system for drug-excipient compatibility evaluation.,"Drug-excipient compatibility study is the essential basis for excipient selection at the pre-formulation stage. According to the pharmaceutical Quality by Design (QbD) principles, a comprehensive understanding of the ingredients' physicochemical properties and a theoretical evaluation of the interaction risk between the drugs and excipients are required for conducting rational compatibility experimental design. Currently, there is an urgent need to establish an artificial intelligence system for researchers to easily get through the problem because it is very inconvenient and hard to utilize those drug-excipient incompatibility data scattered in scientific literature. Here, we designed a knowledge-driven expert system named PharmDE for drug-excipient incompatibility risk evaluation. PharmDE firstly developed an information-rich database to store incompatibility data, covering 532 data items from 228 selected articles. Then, 60 drug-excipient interaction rules were created based on our knowledge and formulation research experiences. Finally, the expert system was developed by organically integrating the database searching and rule-based incompatibility risk prediction, which resulted in four main functionalities: basic search of incompatibility database, data matching by similarity search, drug incompatibility risk evaluation, and formulation incompatibility risk evaluation. PharmDE is expected to be a useful tool for drug-excipient compatibility study and accelerate drug formulation design.

33119751,The MemMoRF database for recognizing disordered protein regions interacting with cellular membranes.,"Protein and lipid membrane interactions play fundamental roles in a large number of cellular processes (e.g. signalling, vesicle trafficking, or viral invasion). A growing number of examples indicate that such interactions can also rely on intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDRs), which can form specific reversible interactions not only with proteins but also with lipids. We named IDRs involved in such membrane lipid-induced disorder-to-order transition as MemMoRFs, in an analogy to IDRs exhibiting disorder-to-order transition upon interaction with protein partners termed Molecular Recognition Features (MoRFs). Currently, both the experimental detection and computational characterization of MemMoRFs are challenging, and information about these regions are scattered in the literature. To facilitate the related investigations we generated a comprehensive database of experimentally validated MemMoRFs based on manual curation of literature and structural data. To characterize the dynamics of MemMoRFs, secondary structure propensity and flexibility calculated from nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shifts were incorporated into the database. These data were supplemented by inclusion of sentences from papers, functional data and disease-related information. The MemMoRF database can be accessed via a user-friendly interface at https://memmorf.hegelab.org, potentially providing a central resource for the characterization of disordered regions in transmembrane and membrane-associated proteins.","Department of Biophysics and Radiation Biology, Semmelweis University, Budapest 1094, Hungary."

33010176,CancerImmunityQTL: a database to systematically evaluate the impact of genetic variants on immune infiltration in human cancer.,"Tumor-infiltrating immune cells as integral component of the tumor microenvironment are associated with tumor progress, prognosis and responses to immunotherapy. Genetic variants have been demonstrated to impact tumor-infiltrating, underscoring the heritable character of immune landscape. Therefore, identification of immunity quantitative trait loci (immunQTLs), which evaluate the effect of genetic variants on immune cells infiltration, might present a critical step toward fully understanding the contribution of genetic variants in tumor development. Although emerging studies have demonstrated the determinants of germline variants on immune infiltration, no database has yet been developed to systematically analyze immunQTLs across multiple cancer types. Using genotype data from TCGA database and immune cell fractions estimated by CIBERSORT, we developed a computational pipeline to identify immunQTLs in 33 cancer types. A total of 913 immunQTLs across different cancer types were identified. Among them, 5 immunQTLs are associated with patient overall survival. Furthermore, by integrating immunQTLs with GWAS data, we identified 527 immunQTLs overlapping with known GWAS linkage disequilibrium regions. Finally, we constructed a user-friendly database, CancerImmunityQTL (http://www.cancerimmunityqtl-hust.com/) for users to browse, search and download data of interest.

32597467,A comprehensive integrated drug similarity resource for in-silico drug repositioning and beyond. ,"Drug similarity studies are driven by the hypothesis that similar drugs should display similar therapeutic actions and thus can potentially treat a similar constellation of diseases. Drug-drug similarity has been derived by variety of direct and indirect sources of evidence and frequently shown high predictive power in discovering validated repositioning candidates as well as other in-silico drug development applications. Yet, existing resources either have limited coverage or rely on an individual source of evidence, overlooking the wealth and diversity of drug-related data sources. Hence, there has been an unmet need for a comprehensive resource integrating diverse drug-related information to derive multi-evidenced drug-drug similarities. We addressed this resource gap by compiling heterogenous information for an exhaustive set of small-molecule drugs (total of 10 367 in the current version) and systematically integrated multiple sources of evidence to derive a multi-modal drug-drug similarity network. The resulting database, 'DrugSimDB' currently includes 238 635 drug pairs with significant aggregated similarity, complemented with an interactive user-friendly web interface (http://vafaeelab.com/drugSimDB.html), which not only enables database ease of access, search, filtration and export, but also provides a variety of complementary information on queried drugs and interactions.

34107869,PINIR: a comprehensive information resource for Pin-II type protease inhibitors.,"<h4>Background</h4>Serine protease inhibitors belonging to the Potato type-II Inhibitor family Protease Inhibitors (Pin-II type PIs) are essential plant defense molecules. They are characterized by multiple inhibitory repeat domains, conserved disulfide bond pattern, and a tripeptide reactive center loop. These features of Pin-II type PIs make them potential molecules for protein engineering and designing inhibitors for agricultural and therapeutic applications. However, the diversity in these PIs remains unexplored due to the lack of annotated protein sequences and their functional attributes in the available databases.<h4>Results</h4>We have developed a database, PINIR (Pin-II type PIs Information Resource), by systematic collection and manual annotation of 415 Pin-II type PI protein sequences. For each PI, the number and position for signature sequences are specified: 695 domains, 75 linkers, 63 reactive center loops, and 10 disulfide bond patterns are identified and mapped. Database analysis revealed novel subcategories of PIs, species-correlated occurrence of inhibitory domains, reactive center loops, and disulfide bond patterns. By analyzing linker regions, we predict that alternative processing at linker regions could generate PI variants in the Solanaceae family.<h4>Conclusion</h4>PINIR ( https://pinir.ncl.res.in ) provides a web interface for browsing and analyzing the protein sequences of Pin-II type PIs. Information about signature sequences, spatio-temporal expression, biochemical properties, gene sequences, and literature references are provided. Analysis of PINIR depicts conserved species-specific features of Pin-II type PI protein sequences. Diversity in the sequence of inhibitory domains and reactive loops directs potential applications to engineer Pin-II type PIs.

Its content has been: used as training data for machine learning models; incorporated to larger databases; and utilized in drug discovery studies for hit identifications.<h4>Description</h4>Here, we report the updated version of SANCDB. The new version includes 412 additional compounds that have been reported since 2015, giving a total of 1012 compounds in the database. Further, although natural products (NPs) are an important source of unique scaffolds, they have a major drawback due to their complex structure resulting in low synthetic feasibility in the laboratory. With this in mind, SANCDB is, now, updated to provide direct links to commercially available analogs from two major chemical databases namely Mcule and MolPort. To our knowledge, this feature is not available in other NP databases. Additionally, for easier access to information by users, the database and website interface were updated. The compounds are now downloadable in many different chemical formats.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The drug discovery process relies heavily on NPs due to their unique chemical organization. This has inspired the establishment of numerous NP chemical databases. With the emergence of newer chemoinformatic technologies, existing chemical databases require constant updates to facilitate information accessibility and integration by users. Besides increasing the NPs compound content, the updated SANCDB allows users to access the individual compounds (if available) or their analogs from commercial databases seamlessly.","Research Unit in Bioinformatics (RUBi), Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Rhodes University, Makhanda/Grahamstown, 6140, South Africa."

32915954,"PanGPCR: predictions for multiple targets, repurposing and side effects.","<h4>Summary</h4>Drug discovery targeting G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest known class of therapeutic targets, is challenging. To facilitate the rapid discovery and development of GPCR drugs, we built a system, PanGPCR, to predict multiple potential GPCR targets and their expression locations in the tissues, side effects and possible repurposing of GPCR drugs. With PanGPCR, the compound of interest is docked to a library of 36 experimentally determined crystal structures comprising of 46 docking sites for human GPCRs, and a ranked list is generated from the docking studies to assess all GPCRs and their binding affinities. Users can determine a given compound's GPCR targets and its repurposing potential accordingly. Moreover, potential side effects collected from the SIDER (Side-Effect Resource) database and mapped to 45 tissues and organs are provided by linking predicted off-targets and their expressed sequence tag profiles. With PanGPCR, multiple targets, repurposing potential and side effects can be determined by simply uploading a small ligand.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>PanGPCR is freely accessible at https://gpcrpanel.cmdm.tw/index.html.<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, National Taiwan University, Taipei 106, Taiwan."

33735471,Update of the CLRP eye plaque brachytherapy database for photon-emitting sources.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To update and extend the Carleton Laboratory for Radiotherapy Physics (CLRP) Eye Plaque (EP) dosimetry database for low-energy photon-emitting brachytherapy sources using egs_brachy, an open-source EGSnrc application. The previous database, CLRP_EPv1, contained datasets for the Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS) plaques (10-22 mm diameter) with <sup>103</sup> Pd or <sup>125</sup> I seeds (BrachyDose-computed, 2008). The new database, CLRP_EPv2, consists of newly calculated three-dimensional (3D) dose distributions for 17 plaques [eight COMS, five Eckert & Ziegler BEBIG, and four others representative of models used worldwide] for <sup>103</sup> Pd, <sup>125</sup> I, and <sup>131</sup> Cs seeds.<h4>Acquisition and validation methods</h4>Plaque models are developed with egs_brachy, based on published/manufacturer dimensions and material data. The BEBIG plaques (modeled for the first time) are identical in dimensions to COMS plaques but differ in elemental composition and/or density. Previously benchmarked seed models are used. Eye plaques and seeds are simulated at the center of full-scatter water phantoms, scoring in (0.05 cm)<sup>3</sup> voxels spanning the eye for scenarios: (a) ""HOMO"": simulated TG43 conditions; (b) ""HETERO"": eye plaques and seeds fully modeled; (c) ""HETsi"" (BEBIG only): one seed is active at a time with other seed geometries present but not emitting photons (inactive); summation over all i seeds in a plaque then yields ""HETsum"" (includes interseed effects). For validation, doses are compared to those from CLRP_EPv1 and published data.<h4>Data format and access</h4>Data are available at https://physics.carleton.ca/clrp/eye_plaque_v2, http://doi.org/10.22215/clrp/EPv2. The data consist of 3D dose distributions (text-based EGSnrc ""3ddose"" file format) and graphical presentations of the comparisons to previously published data.<h4>Potential applications</h4>The CLRP_EPv2 database provides accurate reference 3D dose distributions to advance ocular brachytherapy dose evaluations. The fully-benchmarked eye plaque models will be freely distributed with egs_brachy, supporting adoption of model-based dose evaluations as recommended by TG-129, TG-186, and TG-221.","Carleton Laboratory for Radiotherapy Physics, Department of Physics, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, K1S 5B6, Canada."

33252190,GRIN database: A unified and manually curated repertoire of GRIN variants.,"Glutamatergic neurotransmission is crucial for brain development, wiring neuronal function, and synaptic plasticity mechanisms. Recent genetic studies showed the existence of autosomal dominant de novo GRIN gene variants associated with GRIN-related disorders (GRDs), a rare pediatric neurological disorder caused by N-methyl- d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) dysfunction. Notwithstanding, GRIN variants identification is exponentially growing and their clinical, genetic, and functional annotations remain highly fragmented, representing a bottleneck in GRD patient's stratification. To shorten the gap between GRIN variant identification and patient stratification, we present the GRIN database (GRINdb), a publicly available, nonredundant, updated, and curated database gathering all available genetic, functional, and clinical data from more than 4000 GRIN variants. The manually curated GRINdb outputs on a web server, allowing query and retrieval of reported GRIN variants, and thus representing a fast and reliable bioinformatics resource for molecular clinical advice. Furthermore, the comprehensive mapping of GRIN variants' genetic and clinical information along NMDAR structure revealed important differences in GRIN variants' pathogenicity and clinical phenotypes, shedding light on GRIN-specific fingerprints.

","N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant posttranscriptional modification in mammalian mRNA molecules and has a crucial function in the regulation of many fundamental biological processes. The m6A modification is a dynamic and reversible process regulated by a series of writers, erasers and readers (WERs). Different WERs might have different functions, and even the same WER might function differently in different conditions, which are mostly due to different downstream genes being targeted by the WERs. Therefore, identification of the targets of WERs is particularly important for elucidating this dynamic modification. However, there is still no public repository to host the known targets of WERs. Therefore, we developed the m6A WER target gene database (m6A2Target) to provide a comprehensive resource of the targets of m6A WERs.

34321100,Distinct signatures of codon and codon pair usage in 32 primary tumor types in the novel database CancerCoCoPUTs for cancer-specific codon usage.,"<h4>Background</h4>Gene expression is highly variable across tissues of multi-cellular organisms, influencing the codon usage of the tissue-specific transcriptome. Cancer disrupts the gene expression pattern of healthy tissue resulting in altered codon usage preferences. The topic of codon usage changes as they relate to codon demand, and tRNA supply in cancer is of growing interest.<h4>Methods</h4>We analyzed transcriptome-weighted codon and codon pair usage based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA-seq data from 6427 solid tumor samples and 632 normal tissue samples. This dataset represents 32 cancer types affecting 11 distinct tissues. Our analysis focused on tissues that give rise to multiple solid tumor types and cancer types that are present in multiple tissues.<h4>Results</h4>We identified distinct patterns of synonymous codon usage changes for different cancer types affecting the same tissue. For example, a substantial increase in GGT-glycine was observed in invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), and mixed invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma (IDLC) of the breast. Change in synonymous codon preference favoring GGT correlated with change in synonymous codon preference against GGC in IDC and IDLC, but not in ILC. Furthermore, we examined the codon usage changes between paired healthy/tumor tissue from the same patient. Using clinical data from TCGA, we conducted a survival analysis of patients based on the degree of change between healthy and tumor-specific codon usage, revealing an association between larger changes and increased mortality. We have also created a database that contains cancer-specific codon and codon pair usage data for cancer types derived from TCGA, which represents a comprehensive tool for codon-usage-oriented cancer research.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Based on data from TCGA, we have highlighted tumor type-specific signatures of codon and codon pair usage. Paired data revealed variable changes to codon usage patterns, which must be considered when designing personalized cancer treatments. The associated database, CancerCoCoPUTs, represents a comprehensive resource for codon and codon pair usage in cancer and is available at https://dnahive.fda.gov/review/cancercocoputs/ . These findings are important to understand the relationship between tRNA supply and codon demand in cancer states and could help guide the development of new cancer therapeutics.","Hemostasis Branch, Division of Plasma Protein Therapeutics, Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies, Center for Biologics Evaluation & Research, US Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD, USA."

This poses significant obstacles for smaller laboratories, or laboratories not affiliated with larger projects, which may not have dedicated bioinformatics staff or computing power to effectively use genomic data to protect public health. Building on the success of the cloud-based Galaxy bioinformatics platform ( http://galaxyproject.org ), already known for its user-friendliness and powerful WGS analytical tools, the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN) at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) created a customized 'instance' of the Galaxy environment, called GalaxyTrakr ( https://www.galaxytrakr.org ), for use by laboratory scientists performing food-safety regulatory research. The goal was to enable laboratories outside of the FDA internal network to (1) perform quality assessments of sequence data, (2) identify links between clinical isolates and positive food/environmental samples, including those at the National Center for Biotechnology Information sequence read archive ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/ ), and (3) explore new methodologies such as metagenomics. GalaxyTrakr hosts a variety of free and adaptable tools and provides the data storage and computing power to run the tools. These tools support coordinated analytic methods and consistent interpretation of results across laboratories. Users can create and share tools for their specific needs and use sequence data generated locally and elsewhere.<h4>Results</h4>In its first full year (2018), GalaxyTrakr processed over 85,000 jobs and went from 25 to 250 users, representing 53 different public and state health laboratories, academic institutions, international health laboratories, and federal organizations. By mid-2020, it has grown to 600 registered users and processed over 450,000 analytical jobs. To illustrate how laboratories are making use of this resource, we describe how six institutions use GalaxyTrakr to quickly analyze and review their data.

While considerable amounts of structural and biophysical data have been generated in the last 15 years, the existing functionalities of current resources have limited our ability to rapidly understand the functional and structural properties of microcompartments (MCPs) and their diversity. In order to make the remarkable structural features of bacterial microcompartments accessible to a broad community of scientists and non-specialists, we developed MCPdb: The Bacterial Microcompartment Database (https://mcpdb.mbi.ucla.edu/). MCPdb is a comprehensive resource that categorizes and organizes known microcompartment protein structures and their larger assemblies. To emphasize the critical roles symmetric assembly and architecture play in microcompartment function, each structure in the MCPdb is validated and annotated with respect to: (1) its predicted natural assembly state (2) tertiary structure and topology and (3) the metabolic compartment type from which it derives. The current database includes 163 structures and is available to the public with the anticipation that it will serve as a growing resource for scientists interested in understanding protein-based metabolic organelles in bacteria.","UCLA Molecular Biology Institute, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California, United States of America."

33863373,IrGO: Iranian traditional medicine General Ontology and knowledge base.,"<h4>Background</h4>Iranian traditional medicine, also known as Persian Medicine, is a holistic school of medicine with a long prolific history. It describes numerous concepts and the relationships between them. However, no unified language system has been proposed for the concepts of this medicine up to the present time. Considering the extensive terminology in the numerous textbooks written by the scholars over centuries, comprehending the totality of concepts is obviously a very challenging task. To resolve this issue, overcome the obstacles, and code the concepts in a reusable manner, constructing an ontology of the concepts of Iranian traditional medicine seems a necessity.<h4>Construction and content</h4>Makhzan al-Advieh, an encyclopedia of materia medica compiled by Mohammad Hossein Aghili Khorasani, was selected as the resource to create an ontology of the concepts used to describe medicinal substances. The steps followed to accomplish this task included (1) compiling the list of classes via examination of textbooks, and text mining the resource followed by manual review to ensure comprehensiveness of extracted terms; (2) arranging the classes in a taxonomy; (3) determining object and data properties; (4) specifying annotation properties including ID, labels (English and Persian), alternative terms, and definitions (English and Persian); (5) ontology evaluation. The ontology was created using Protégé with adherence to the principles of ontology development provided by the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO) foundry.<h4>Utility and discussion</h4>The ontology was finalized with inclusion of 3521 classes, 15 properties, and 20,903 axioms in the Iranian traditional medicine General Ontology (IrGO) database, freely available at http://ir-go.net/ . An indented list and an interactive graph view using WebVOWL were used to visualize the ontology. All classes were linked to their instances in UNaProd database to create a knowledge base of ITM materia medica.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We constructed an ontology-based knowledge base of ITM concepts in the domain of materia medica to help offer a shared and common understanding of this concept, enable reuse of the knowledge, and make the assumptions explicit. This ontology will aid Persian medicine practitioners in clinical decision-making to select drugs. Extending IrGO will bridge the gap between traditional and conventional schools of medicine, helping guide future research in the process of drug discovery.","Department of Traditional Medicine, School of Persian Medicine, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."

33766657,An early-morning gene network controlled by phytochromes and cryptochromes regulates photomorphogenesis pathways in Arabidopsis.,"Light perception at dawn plays a key role in coordinating multiple molecular processes and in entraining the plant circadian clock. The Arabidopsis mutant lacking the main photoreceptors, however, still shows clock entrainment, indicating that the integration of light into the morning transcriptome is not well understood. In this study, we performed a high-resolution RNA-sequencing time-series experiment, sampling every 2 min beginning at dawn. In parallel experiments, we perturbed temperature, the circadian clock, photoreceptor signaling, and chloroplast-derived light signaling. We used these data to infer a gene network that describes the gene expression dynamics after light stimulus in the morning, and then validated key edges. By sampling time points at high density, we are able to identify three light- and temperature-sensitive bursts of transcription factor activity, one of which lasts for only about 8 min. Phytochrome and cryptochrome mutants cause a delay in the transcriptional bursts at dawn, and completely remove a burst of expression in key photomorphogenesis genes (HY5 and BBX family). Our complete network is available online (http://www-users.york.ac.uk/∼de656/dawnBurst/dawnBurst.html). Taken together, our results show that phytochrome and cryptochrome signaling is required for fine-tuning the dawn transcriptional response to light, but separate pathways can robustly activate much of the program in their absence.","Sainsbury Laboratory, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK."

34296749,circExp database: an online transcriptome platform for human circRNA expressions in cancers. ,"Circular RNA (circRNA) is a highly stable, single-stranded, closed-loop RNA that works as RNA or as a protein decoy to regulate gene expression. In humans, thousands of circRNA transcriptional products precisely express in specific developmental stages, tissues and cell types. Due to their stability and specificity, circRNAs are ideal biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. To provide an integrated and standardized circRNA expression profile for human cancers, we performed extensive data curation across 11 technical platforms, collecting 48 expression profile data sets for 18 cancer types and amassing 860 751 expression records. We also identified 189 193 differential expression signatures that are significantly different between normal and cancer samples. All the pre-calculated expression analysis results are organized into 132 plain text files for bulk download. Our online interface, circExp, provides data browsing and search functions. For each data set, a dynamic expression heatmap provides a profile overview. Based on the processed data, we found that 52 circRNAs were consistently and differentially expressed in 20 or more processed analyses. By mapping those circRNAs to their parent protein-coding genes, we found that they may have profoundly affected the survival of 10 797 patients in the The Cancer Genome Atlas pan-cancer data set. In sum, we developed circExp and demonstrated that it is useful to identify circRNAs that have potential diagnostic and prognostic significance for a variety of cancer types.

34302483,piRNAclusterDB 2.0: update and expansion of the piRNA cluster database.,"PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and their partnering PIWI proteins defend the animal germline against transposable elements and play a crucial role in fertility. Numerous studies in the past have uncovered many additional functions of the piRNA pathway, including gene regulation, anti-viral defense, and somatic transposon repression. Further, comparative analyses across phylogenetic groups showed that the PIWI/piRNA system evolves rapidly and exhibits great evolutionary plasticity. However, the presence of so-called piRNA clusters as the major source of piRNAs is common to nearly all metazoan species. These genomic piRNA-producing loci are highly divergent across taxa and critically influence piRNA populations in different evolutionary lineages. We launched the initial version of the piRNA cluster database to facilitate research on regulation and evolution of piRNA-producing loci across tissues und species. In recent years the amount of small RNA sequencing data that was generated and the abundance of species that were studied has grown rapidly. To keep up with this recent progress, we have released a major update for the piRNA cluster database (https://www.smallrnagroup.uni-mainz.de/piRNAclusterDB), expanding it from 12 to a total of 51 species with hundreds of new datasets, and revised its overall structure to enable easy navigation through this large amount of data.","Institute of Organismic and Molecular Evolution, Anthropology, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz 55099, Germany."
34314492,"Enhancing the interoperability of glycan data flow between ChEBI, PubChem and GlyGen.","Glycans play a vital role in health, disease, bioenergy, biomaterials and bio-therapeutics. As a result, there is keen interest to identify and increase glycan data in bioinformatics databases like ChEBI and PubChem, and connecting them to resources at the EMBL-EBI and NCBI to facilitate access to important annotations at a global level. GlyTouCan is a comprehensive archival database that contains glycans obtained primarily through batch upload from glycan repositories, glycoprotein databases and individual laboratories. In many instances, the glycan structures deposited in GlyTouCan may not be fully defined or have supporting experimental evidence and citations. Databases like ChEBI and PubChem were designed to accommodate complete atomistic structures with well-defined chemical linkages. As a result, they cannot easily accommodate the structural ambiguity inherent in glycan databases. Consequently, there is a need to improve the organization of glycan data coherently to enhance connectivity across the major NCBI, EMBL-EBI and glycoscience databases. This paper outlines a workflow developed in collaboration between GlyGen, ChEBI and PubChem to improve the visibility and connectivity of glycan data across these resources. GlyGen hosts a subset of glycans (~29,000) from the GlyTouCan database and has submitted valuable glycan annotations to the PubChem database and integrated over 10,500 (including ambiguously defined) glycans into the ChEBI database. The integrated glycans were prioritized based on links to PubChem and connectivity to glycoprotein data. The pipeline provides a blueprint for how glycan data can be harmonized between different resources.

34025934,Computational modeling and bioinformatic analyses of functional mutations in drug target genes in <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>.,"Tuberculosis (TB) continues to be the leading cause of deaths due to its persistent drug resistance and the consequent ineffectiveness of anti-TB treatment. Recent years witnessed huge amount of sequencing data, revealing mutations responsible for drug resistance. However, the lack of an up-to-date repository remains a barrier towards utilization of these data and identifying major mutations-associated with resistance. Amongst all mutations, non-synonymous mutations alter the amino acid sequence of a protein and have a much greater effect on pathogenicity. Hence, this type of gene mutation is of prime interest of the present study. The purpose of this study is to develop an updated database comprising almost all reported substitutions within the <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (<i>M.tb</i>) drug target genes <i>rpoB</i>, <i>inhA</i>, <i>katG</i>, <i>pncA</i>, <i>gyrA</i> and <i>gyrB.</i> Various bioinformatics prediction tools were used to assess the structural and biophysical impacts of the resistance causing non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) at the molecular level. This was followed by evaluating the impact of these mutations on binding affinity of the drugs to target proteins. We have developed a comprehensive online resource named MycoTRAP-DB (<i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> Resistance Associated Polymorphisms Database) that connects mutations in genes with their structural, functional and pathogenic implications on protein. This database is accessible at http://139.59.12.92.

The NDB enables physics-based simulation of chromosomal structural dynamics through the MEGABASE + MiChroM computational pipeline. The input of the pipeline consists of epigenetic information sourced from the Encode database; the output consists of the trajectories of chromosomal motions that accurately predict Hi-C and fluorescence insitu hybridization data, as well as multiple observations of chromosomal dynamics in vivo. As an intermediate step, users can also generate chromosomal sub-compartment annotations directly from the same epigenetic input, without the use of any DNA-DNA proximity ligation data. Additionally, the NDB freely hosts both experimental and computational structural genomics data. Besides being able to perform their own genome simulations and download the hosted data, users can also analyze and visualize the same data through custom-designed web-based tools. In particular, the one-dimensional genetic and epigenetic data can be overlaid onto accurate 3D structures of chromosomes, to study the spatial distribution of genetic and epigenetic features.

33685383,lncRNADetector: a bioinformatics pipeline for long non-coding RNA identification and MAPslnc: a repository of medicinal and aromatic plant lncRNAs.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are an emerging class of non-coding RNAs and potent regulatory elements in the living cells. High throughput RNA sequencing analyses have generated a tremendous amount of transcript sequence data. A large proportion of these transcript sequences does not code for proteins and are known as non-coding RNAs. Among them, lncRNAs are a unique class of transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides with diverse biological functions and regulatory mechanisms. Recent emerging studies and next-generation sequencing technologies show a substantial amount of lncRNAs within the plant genome, which are yet to be identified. The computational identification of lncRNAs from these transcripts is a challenging task due to the involvement of a series of filtering steps. We have developed lncRNADetector, a bioinformatics pipeline for the identification of novel lncRNAs, especially from medicinal and aromatic plant (MAP) species. The lncRNADetector has been utilized to analyse and identify more than 88,459 lncRNAs from 21 species of MAPs. To provide a knowledge resource for the plant research community towards elucidating the diversity of biological roles of lncRNAs, the information generated about MAP lncRNAs (post-filtering steps) through lncRNADetector has been stored and organized in MAPslnc database (MAPslnc, https://lncrnapipe.cimap.res.in). The lncRNADetector web server and MAPslnc database have been developed in order to facilitate researchers for accurate identification of lncRNAs from the next-generation sequencing data of different organisms for downstream studies.

33147622,KNIndex: a comprehensive database of physicochemical properties for k-tuple nucleotides. ,"With the development of high-throughput sequencing technology, the genomic sequences increased exponentially over the last decade. In order to decode these new genomic data, machine learning methods were introduced for genome annotation and analysis. Due to the requirement of most machines learning methods, the biological sequences must be represented as fixed-length digital vectors. In this representation procedure, the physicochemical properties of k-tuple nucleotides are important information. However, the values of the physicochemical properties of k-tuple nucleotides are scattered in different resources. To facilitate the studies on genomic sequences, we developed the first comprehensive database, namely KNIndex (https://knindex.pufengdu.org), for depositing and visualizing physicochemical properties of k-tuple nucleotides. Currently, the KNIndex database contains 182 properties including one for mononucleotide (DNA), 169 for dinucleotide (147 for DNA and 22 for RNA) and 12 for trinucleotide (DNA). KNIndex database also provides a user-friendly web-based interface for the users to browse, query, visualize and download the physicochemical properties of k-tuple nucleotides. With the built-in conversion and visualization functions, users are allowed to display DNA/RNA sequences as curves of multiple physicochemical properties.

CNVs further cause genetic diversity in healthy populations and are predominant drivers of gene/genome evolution. Initiatives have been taken by the research community to establish large-scale databases to comprehensively characterize CNVs in humans. Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) is one such endeavor that catalogs CNVs, of nearly 60 000 healthy individuals across five demographic clusters. Furthermore, large projects such as the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) combine CNA data from cancer-affected individuals and large panels of human cancer cell lines, respectively. However, we lack a structured and comprehensive CNV/CNA resource including both healthy individuals and cancer patients across large populations. CNVIntegrate is the first web-based system that hosts CNV and CNA data from both healthy populations and cancer patients, respectively, and concomitantly provides statistical comparisons between copy number frequencies of multiple ethnic populations.

In tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), the availability of the genome sequence, followed by the resequencing of tomato cultivars and its wild relatives, has provided a prodigious resource for the improvement of traits. A high-quality genome resequencing of 84 tomato accessions and wild relatives generated a dataset that can be used as a resource to identify agronomically important alleles across the genome. Converting this dataset into a searchable database, including information about the influence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on protein function, provides valuable information about the genetic variations. The database will assist in searching for functional variants of a gene for introgression into tomato cultivars.<h4>Results</h4>A recent release of better-quality tomato genome reference assembly SL3.0, and new annotation ITAG3.2 of SL3.0, dropped 3857 genes, added 4900 novel genes and updated 20 766 genes. Using the above version, we remapped the data from the tomato lines resequenced under the '100 tomato genome resequencing project' on new tomato genome assembly SL3.0 and made an online searchable Tomato Genomic Variations (TGVs) database.

These lncRNAs show surprising levels of expression variability between different cell clusters, and has the comparable cell classification ability as known marker genes. Cell-specific lncRNAs have been identified and further validated by in vitro experiments. We found that lncRNAs are typically co-expressed with the mRNAs in the same cell cluster, which can be used to uncover lncRNAs' functions. Our study emphasizes the need to uncover lncRNAs in all cell types and shows the power of lncRNAs as novel marker genes at single cell resolution.","Key Laboratory of Gene Engineering of the Ministry of Education, State Key Laboratory for Biocontrol, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510275, P.

34042771,Introducing a Platform for Integrating and Sharing Stem Cell Research Data.,"Advancements in regenerative medicine have highlighted the need for increased standardization and sharing of stem cell products to help drive these innovative interventions toward public availability and to increase collaboration in the scientific community. Although numerous attempts and numerous databases have been made to store this data, there is still a lack of a platform that incorporates heterogeneous stem cell information into a harmonized project-based framework. The aim of the platform described in this study, ReMeDy, is to provide an intelligent informatics solution which integrates diverse stem cell product characteristics with study subject and omics information. In the resulting platform, heterogeneous data is validated using predefined ontologies and stored in a relational database. In this initial feasibility study, testing of the ReMeDy functionality was performed using published, publically-available induced pluripotent stem cell projects conducted in in vitro, preclinical and intervention evaluations. It demonstrated the robustness of ReMeDy for storing diverse iPSC data, by seamlessly harmonizing diverse common data elements, and the potential utility of this platform for driving knowledge generation from the aggregation of this shared data. Next steps include increasing the number of curated projects by developing a crowdsourcing framework for data upload and an automated pipeline for metadata abstraction.

34174819,UniBind: maps of high-confidence direct TF-DNA interactions across nine species.,"<h4>Background</h4>Transcription factors (TFs) bind specifically to TF binding sites (TFBSs) at cis-regulatory regions to control transcription. It is critical to locate these TF-DNA interactions to understand transcriptional regulation. Efforts to predict bona fide TFBSs benefit from the availability of experimental data mapping DNA binding regions of TFs (chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing - ChIP-seq).<h4>Results</h4>In this study, we processed ~ 10,000 public ChIP-seq datasets from nine species to provide high-quality TFBS predictions. After quality control, it culminated with the prediction of ~ 56 million TFBSs with experimental and computational support for direct TF-DNA interactions for 644 TFs in > 1000 cell lines and tissues. These TFBSs were used to predict > 197,000 cis-regulatory modules representing clusters of binding events in the corresponding genomes. The high-quality of the TFBSs was reinforced by their evolutionary conservation, enrichment at active cis-regulatory regions, and capacity to predict combinatorial binding of TFs. Further, we confirmed that the cell type and tissue specificity of enhancer activity was correlated with the number of TFs with binding sites predicted in these regions. All the data is provided to the community through the UniBind database that can be accessed through its web-interface ( https://unibind.uio.no/ ), a dedicated RESTful API, and as genomic tracks. Finally, we provide an enrichment tool, available as a web-service and an R package, for users to find TFs with enriched TFBSs in a set of provided genomic regions.<h4>Conclusions</h4>UniBind is the first resource of its kind, providing the largest collection of high-confidence direct TF-DNA interactions in nine species.","Centre for Molecular Medicine Norway (NCMM), Nordic EMBL Partnership, University of Oslo, 0349, Oslo, Norway."

Protein tandem repeats are ubiquitous in all branches of the tree of life. The accumulation of solved repeat structures provides new possibilities for classification and detection, but also increasing the need for annotation. Here we present RepeatsDB 3.0, which addresses these challenges and presents an extended classification scheme. The major conceptual change compared to the previous version is the hierarchical classification combining top levels based solely on structural similarity (Class > Topology > Fold) with two new levels (Clan > Family) requiring sequence similarity and describing repeat motifs in collaboration with Pfam. Data growth has been addressed with improved mechanisms for browsing the classification hierarchy. A new UniProt-centric view unifies the increasingly frequent annotation of structures from identical or similar sequences.

Although several exosome-related databases have been developed, there is still lacking of an integrated database for exosome-based biomarker discovery. To this end, a comprehensive database ExoBCD (https://exobcd.liumwei.org) was constructed with the combination of robust analysis of four high-throughput datasets, transcriptome validation of 1191 TCGA cases and manual mining of 950 studies. In ExoBCD, approximately 20 900 annotation entries were integrated from 25 external sources and 306 exosomal molecules (49 potential biomarkers and 257 biologically interesting molecules). The latter could be divided into 3 molecule types, including 121 mRNAs, 172 miRNAs and 13 lncRNAs. Thus, the well-linked information about molecular characters, experimental biology, gene expression patterns, overall survival, functional evidence, tumour stage and clinical use were fully integrated. As a data-driven and literature-based paradigm proposed of biomarker discovery, this study also demonstrated the corroborative analysis and identified 36 promising molecules, as well as the most promising prognostic biomarkers, IGF1R and FRS2.

Yet, a systematic study on the switch in their interaction pattern between activation and suppression and between normal and cancer conditions based on multi-omics evidences is not available. We built miRactDB, a database for miRNA-gene interaction, at https://ccsm.uth.edu/miRactDB, to provide a versatile resource and platform for annotation and interpretation of miRNA-gene relations. We conducted a comprehensive investigation on miRNA-gene interactions and their biological implications across tissue types in both tumour and normal conditions, based on TCGA, CCLE and GTEx databases. We particularly explored the genetic and epigenetic mechanisms potentially contributing to the positive correlation, including identification of miRNA binding sites in the gene coding sequence (CDS) and promoter regions of partner genes. Integrative analysis based on this resource revealed that top-ranked genes derived from TCGA tumour and adjacent normal samples share an overwhelming part of biological processes, which are quite different than those from CCLE and GTEx. The most active miRNAs predicted to target CDS and promoter regions are largely overlapped. These findings corroborate that adjacent normal tissues might have undergone significant molecular transformations towards oncogenesis before phenotypic and histological change; and there probably exists a small yet critical set of miRNAs that profoundly influence various cancer hallmark processes. miRactDB provides a unique resource for the cancer and genomics communities to screen, prioritize and rationalize their candidates of miRNA-gene interactions, in both normal and cancer scenarios.",NA

By gathering publicly available sORF data, normalizing them and summarizing redundant information, we were able to identify a total of 1 162 675 unique sORFs. Despite the usual characterization of ORFs as short, upstream or downstream, there is currently no clear consensus regarding the definition of these categories. Thus, the data have been reprocessed using a normalized nomenclature. MetamORF enables new analyses at locus, gene, transcript and ORF levels, which should offer the possibility to address new questions regarding sORF functions in the future. The repository is available through an user-friendly web interface, allowing easy browsing, visualization, filtering over multiple criteria and export possibilities. sORFs can be searched starting from a gene, a transcript and an ORF ID, looking in a genome area or browsing the whole repository for a species. The database content has also been made available through track hubs at UCSC Genome Browser. Finally, we demonstrated an enrichment of genes harboring upstream ORFs among genes expressed in response to reticular stress.

33985427,TarDB: an online database for plant miRNA targets and miRNA-triggered phased siRNAs.,"<h4>Background</h4>In plants, microRNAs (miRNAs) are pivotal regulators of plant development and stress responses. Different computational tools and web servers have been developed for plant miRNA target prediction; however, in silico prediction normally contains false positive results. In addition, many plant miRNA target prediction servers lack information for miRNA-triggered phased small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs). Creating a comprehensive and relatively high-confidence plant miRNA target database is much needed.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we report TarDB, an online database that collects three categories of relatively high-confidence plant miRNA targets: (i) cross-species conserved miRNA targets; (ii) degradome/PARE (Parallel Analysis of RNA Ends) sequencing supported miRNA targets; (iii) miRNA-triggered phasiRNA loci. TarDB provides a user-friendly interface that enables users to easily search, browse and retrieve miRNA targets and miRNA initiated phasiRNAs in a broad variety of plants. TarDB has a comprehensive collection of reliable plant miRNA targets containing previously unreported miRNA targets and miRNA-triggered phasiRNAs even in the well-studied model species. Most of these novel miRNA targets are relevant to lineage-specific or species-specific miRNAs. TarDB data is freely available at http://www.biosequencing.cn/TarDB .<h4>Conclusions</h4>In summary, TarDB serves as a useful web resource for exploring relatively high-confidence miRNA targets and miRNA-triggered phasiRNAs in plants.","College of Life Sciences, Tianjin Key Laboratory of Animal and Plant Resistance, Tianjin Normal University, Tianjin, 300387, China."
33882119,BC-TFdb: a database of transcription factor drivers in breast cancer. ,"Transcription factors (TFs) are DNA-binding proteins, which regulate many essential biological functions. In several cancer types, TF function is altered by various direct mechanisms, including gene amplification or deletion, point mutations, chromosomal translocations, expression alterations, as well as indirectly by non-coding DNA mutations influencing the binding of the TF. TFs are also actively involved in breast cancer (BC) initiation and progression. Herein, we have developed an open-access database, BC-TFdb (Breast Cancer Transcription Factors database), of curated, non-redundant TF involved in BC. The database provides BC driver TFs related information including genomic sequences, proteomic sequences, structural data, pathway information, mutations information, DNA binding residues, survival and therapeutic resources. The database will be a useful platform for researchers to obtain BC-related TF-specific information.

34090324,Reproducible and accessible analysis of transposon insertion sequencing in Galaxy for qualitative essentiality analyses.,"<h4>Background</h4>Significant progress has been made in advancing and standardizing tools for human genomic and biomedical research. Yet, the field of next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis for microorganisms (including multiple pathogens) remains fragmented, lacks accessible and reusable tools, is hindered by local computational resource limitations, and does not offer widely accepted standards. One such ""problem areas"" is the analysis of Transposon Insertion Sequencing (TIS) data. TIS allows probing of almost the entire genome of a microorganism by introducing random insertions of transposon-derived constructs. The impact of the insertions on the survival and growth under specific conditions provides precise information about genes affecting specific phenotypic characteristics. A wide array of tools has been developed to analyze TIS data. Among the variety of options available, it is often difficult to identify which one can provide a reliable and reproducible analysis.<h4>Results</h4>Here we sought to understand the challenges and propose reliable practices for the analysis of TIS experiments. Using data from two recent TIS studies, we have developed a series of workflows that include multiple tools for data de-multiplexing, promoter sequence identification, transposon flank alignment, and read count repartition across the genome. Particular attention was paid to quality control procedures, such as determining the optimal tool parameters for the analysis and removal of contamination.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our work provides an assessment of the currently available tools for TIS data analysis. It offers ready to use workflows that can be invoked by anyone in the world using our public Galaxy platform ( https://usegalaxy.org ). To lower the entry barriers, we have also developed interactive tutorials explaining details of TIS data analysis procedures at https://bit.ly/gxy-tis .","Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Department, Eberly College of Science, The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania, USA."
34330336,HumGut: a comprehensive human gut prokaryotic genomes collection filtered by metagenome data.,"<h4>Background</h4>A major bottleneck in the use of metagenome sequencing for human gut microbiome studies has been the lack of a comprehensive genome collection to be used as a reference database. Several recent efforts have been made to re-construct genomes from human gut metagenome data, resulting in a huge increase in the number of relevant genomes. In this work, we aimed to create a collection of the most prevalent healthy human gut prokaryotic genomes, to be used as a reference database, including both MAGs from the human gut and ordinary RefSeq genomes.<h4>Results</h4>We screened > 5,700 healthy human gut metagenomes for the containment of > 490,000 publicly available prokaryotic genomes sourced from RefSeq and the recently announced UHGG collection. This resulted in a pool of > 381,000 genomes that were subsequently scored and ranked based on their prevalence in the healthy human metagenomes. The genomes were then clustered at a 97.5% sequence identity resolution, and cluster representatives (30,691 in total) were retained to comprise the HumGut collection. Using the Kraken2 software for classification, we find superior performance in the assignment of metagenomic reads, classifying on average 94.5% of the reads in a metagenome, as opposed to 86% with UHGG and 44% when using standard Kraken2 database. A coarser HumGut collection, consisting of genomes dereplicated at 95% sequence identity-similar to UHGG, classified 88.25% of the reads. HumGut, half the size of standard Kraken2 database and directly comparable to the UHGG size, outperforms them both.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The HumGut collection contains > 30,000 genomes clustered at a 97.5% sequence identity resolution and ranked by human gut prevalence. We demonstrate how metagenomes from IBD-patients map equally well to this collection, indicating this reference is relevant also for studies well outside the metagenome reference set used to obtain HumGut.

33010163,cncRNAdb: a manually curated resource of experimentally supported RNAs with both protein-coding and noncoding function.,"RNA endowed with both protein-coding and noncoding functions is referred to as 'dual-function RNA', 'binary functional RNA (bifunctional RNA)' or 'cncRNA (coding and noncoding RNA)'. Recently, an increasing number of cncRNAs have been identified, including both translated ncRNAs (ncRNAs with coding functions) and untranslated mRNAs (mRNAs with noncoding functions). However, an appropriate database for storing and organizing cncRNAs is still lacking. Here, we developed cncRNAdb, a manually curated database of experimentally supported cncRNAs, which aims to provide a resource for efficient manipulation, browsing and analysis of cncRNAs. The current version of cncRNAdb documents about 2600 manually curated entries of cncRNA functions with experimental evidence, involving more than 2,000 RNAs (including over 1300 translated ncRNAs and over 600 untranslated mRNAs) across over 20 species. In summary, we believe that cncRNAdb will help elucidate the functions and mechanisms of cncRNAs and develop new prediction methods.

33705530,Development of a biomarker database toward performing disease classification and finding disease interrelations. ,"A biomarker is a measurable indicator of a disease or abnormal state of a body that plays an important role in disease diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. The biomarker has become a significant topic due to its versatile usage in the medical field and in rapid detection of the presence or severity of some diseases. The volume of biomarker data is rapidly increasing and the identified data are scattered. To provide comprehensive information, the explosively growing data need to be recorded in a single platform. There is no open-source freely available comprehensive online biomarker database. To fulfill this purpose, we have developed a human biomarker database as part of the KNApSAcK family databases which contain a vast quantity of information on the relationships between biomarkers and diseases. We have classified the diseases into 18 disease classes, mostly according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information definitions. Apart from this database development, we also have performed disease classification by separately using protein and metabolite biomarkers based on the network clustering algorithm DPClusO and hierarchical clustering. Finally, we reached a conclusion about the relationships among the disease classes. The human biomarker database can be accessed online and the inter-disease relationships may be helpful in understanding the molecular mechanisms of diseases. To our knowledge, this is one of the first approaches to classify diseases based on biomarkers.

34225788,A global overview of genetically interpretable multimorbidities among common diseases in the UK Biobank.,"<h4>Background</h4>Multimorbidities greatly increase the global health burdens, but the landscapes of their genetic risks have not been systematically investigated.<h4>Methods</h4>We used the hospital inpatient data of 385,335 patients in the UK Biobank to investigate the multimorbid relations among 439 common diseases. Post-GWAS analyses were performed to identify multimorbidity shared genetic risks at the genomic loci, network, as well as overall genetic architecture levels. We conducted network decomposition for the networks of genetically interpretable multimorbidities to detect the hub diseases and the involved molecules and functions in each module.<h4>Results</h4>In total, 11,285 multimorbidities among 439 common diseases were identified, and 46% of them were genetically interpretable at the loci, network, or overall genetic architecture levels. Multimorbidities affecting the same and different physiological systems displayed different patterns of the shared genetic components, with the former more likely to share loci-level genetic components while the latter more likely to share network-level genetic components. Moreover, both the loci- and network-level genetic components shared by multimorbidities converged on cell immunity, protein metabolism, and gene silencing. Furthermore, we found that the genetically interpretable multimorbidities tend to form network modules, mediated by hub diseases and featuring physiological categories. Finally, we showcased how hub diseases mediating the multimorbidity modules could help provide useful insights for the genetic contributors of multimorbidities.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Our results provide a systematic resource for understanding the genetic predispositions of multimorbidities and indicate that hub diseases and converged molecules and functions may be the key for treating multimorbidities.

Although the number of hospital patients using interventions such as the video consultation has increased in recent years only a small proportion of the outpatient and inpatient visits involve telemedicine. The TELEMED database (https://telemedicine.cimt.dk/) has been launched at the Center for Innovative Medical Technology in Denmark to ensure that hospital managers and healthcare professionals have access to information about telemedicine services and their effectiveness. This article describes the development and the content of the TELEMED database.<h4>Methods</h4>A structured literature search was made in the PubMed Database for randomised controlled trials or observational studies with a control group that investigated the effect of telemedicine interventions for hospital patients. Data were extracted from each article on the clinical effectiveness, patient perceptions, economic effects and implementation challenges. As the database should only provide inspiration to healthcare professionals regarding possibilities for use of telemedicine, the risk of bias in the studies was not assessed.<h4>Results</h4>The literature search resulted in 2825 hits. Based on full text assessment, 331 articles were included for data extraction and assessment. These articles present telemedicine services used in 22 different medical specialities. Forty-eight percent of the studies found a positive, statistically significant clinical effect, while 47% showed no statistically significant difference. In 48% of the studies, patients' experiences were examined and of these 68% found positive patient experiences. Fifty-four percent of the articles included information on the economic effects and, of these, 51% found reduction in healthcare utilization.

To facilitate research on COVID-19, we have revised the Pfam entries that cover the SARS-CoV-2 proteome, and built new entries for regions that were not covered by Pfam. We have reintroduced Pfam-B which provides an automatically generated supplement to Pfam and contains 136 730 novel clusters of sequences that are not yet matched by a Pfam family. The new Pfam-B is based on a clustering by the MMseqs2 software. We have compared all of the regions in the RepeatsDB to those in Pfam and have started to use the results to build and refine Pfam repeat families.

34349127,"MiREDiBase, a manually curated database of validated and putative editing events in microRNAs.","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are regulatory small non-coding RNAs that function as translational repressors. MiRNAs are involved in most cellular processes, and their expression and function are presided by several factors. Amongst, miRNA editing is an epitranscriptional modification that alters the original nucleotide sequence of selected miRNAs, possibly influencing their biogenesis and target-binding ability. A-to-I and C-to-U RNA editing are recognized as the canonical types, with the A-to-I type being the predominant one. Albeit some bioinformatics resources have been implemented to collect RNA editing data, it still lacks a comprehensive resource explicitly dedicated to miRNA editing. Here, we present MiREDiBase, a manually curated catalog of editing events in miRNAs. The current version includes 3,059 unique validated and putative editing sites from 626 pre-miRNAs in humans and three primates. Editing events in mature human miRNAs are supplied with miRNA-target predictions and enrichment analysis, while minimum free energy structures are inferred for edited pre-miRNAs.

34025412,The Genus <i>Eriosema</i> (Fabaceae): From the Ethnopharmacology to an Evidence-Based Phytotherapeutic Perspective?,"The genus <i>Eriosema</i> (Fabaceae) includes approximately 150 species widely distributed across tropical and subtropical regions of the world (Africa, Neotropics, Asia and Australia). Throughout these regions, several species are used since centuries in different traditional medicinal systems, while others are used as food or food supplement. The present review attempts to critically summarize current information concerning the uses, phytochemistry and pharmacology of the <i>Eriosema</i> genus and to evaluate the therapeutic potential. The information published in English and French (up to September 2020) on ethnopharmacology or traditional uses, chemistry, pharmacology and toxicology of <i>Eriosema</i> genus was collected from electronic databases [SciFinder, PubMed, Google, Google Scholar, Scopus, Web of Science, Prelude Medicinal Plants-http://www.ethnopharmacologia.org/recherche-dans-prelude/?plant, The Plant List (http://www.theplantlist.org/), POWO (http://powo.science.kew.org/) and IUCN Red List Categories (https://www.iucnredlist.org/)], conference proceedings, books, M.Sc. and Ph.D. dissertations. The information retrieved on the ethnomedicinal indications of <i>Eriosema</i> genus allowed to list 25 species (∼16.6% of the genus). The majority of uses is recorded from Africa. Phytochemical analyses of 8 species led to the identification and/or isolation of 107 compounds, with flavonoids (69.2%), chromones (7.5%) and benzoic acid derivatives (3.7%) as the main chemical classes. Pharmacological investigations with crude extracts and isolated compounds showed a broad range of activities including aphrodisiac, estrogenic, anti-osteoporosis, hypolipidemic, anti-diabetic, anti-diarrheal, anti-microbial, anti-oxidant, anthelmintic, anti-cancer, and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities. Despite the low number of <i>Eriosema</i> species tested, there is convincing evidence in <i>vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> studies validating some traditional and ethnobotanical uses. However, the utility of several of the described uses has not yet been confirmed in pharmacological studies. Reviewed data could serve as a reference tool and preliminary information for advanced research on <i>Eriosema</i> species.","Department of Biology of Animal Organisms, Faculty of Science, University of Douala, Douala, Cameroon."

Data can be difficult to find despite existing online blood group resources and genetic and literature databases. We have developed a modern, elaborate database for D variants, thanks to an extensive literature search with meticulous curation of 387 peer-reviewed articles and 80 abstracts from major conferences and other sources. RHeference contains entries for 710 RHD alleles, 11 RHCE alleles, 30 phenotype descriptions (preventing data loss from historical sources), 35 partly characterized alleles, 3 haplotypes, and 16 miscellaneous entries. The entries include molecular, phenotypic, serological, alloimmunization, haplotype, geographical, and other data, detailed for each source. The main characteristics are summarized for each entry. The sources for all information are included and easily accessible through doi and PMID links. Overall, the database contains more than 10,000 individual pieces of data. We have set up the database architecture based on our previous expertise on database setup and biocuration for other topics, using modern technologies such as the Django framework, BioPython, Bootstrap, and Jquery. This architecture allows an easy access to data and enables simple and complex queries: combining multiple mutations, keywords, or any of the characteristics included in the database.

33051688,dbGuide: a database of functionally validated guide RNAs for genome editing in human and mouse cells.,"With the technology's accessibility and ease of use, CRISPR has been employed widely in many different organisms and experimental settings. As a result, thousands of publications have used CRISPR to make specific genetic perturbations, establishing in itself a resource of validated guide RNA sequences. While numerous computational tools to assist in the design and identification of candidate guide RNAs exist, these are still just at best predictions and generally, researchers inevitably will test multiple sequences for functional activity. Here, we present dbGuide (https://sgrnascorer.cancer.gov/dbguide), a database of functionally validated guide RNA sequences for CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout in human and mouse. Our database not only contains computationally determined candidate guide RNA sequences, but of even greater value, over 4000 sequences which have been functionally validated either through direct amplicon sequencing or manual curation of literature from over 1000 publications. Finally, our established framework will allow for continual addition of newly published and experimentally validated guide RNA sequences for CRISPR/Cas9-based knockout as well as incorporation of sequences from different gene editing systems, additional species and other types of site-specific functionalities such as base editing, gene activation, repression and epigenetic modification.","Laboratory Animal Sciences Program, Frederick National Lab for Cancer Research, Frederick, MD 21702, USA."

As advances occur in our capability to create more detailed fault-based hazard models, depending on the availability of primary data and observations, it is desirable that such data can be organized in a way that is easily understood and incorporated into present and future models. The database structure presented herein aims to assist this process. We recommend stating what observations have led to different location and activity certainty and presenting slip-rate data with point location coordinates of where the data were collected with the time periods over which they were calculated. Such data reporting allows more complete uncertainty analyses in hazard and risk modelling.

34224351,Deep Learning for Ultrasound Image Formation: CUBDL Evaluation Framework and Open Datasets.,"Deep learning for ultrasound image formation is rapidly garnering research support and attention, quickly rising as the latest frontier in ultrasound image formation, with much promise to balance both image quality and display speed. Despite this promise, one challenge with identifying optimal solutions is the absence of unified evaluation methods and datasets that are not specific to a single research group. This article introduces the largest known international database of ultrasound channel data and describes the associated evaluation methods that were initially developed for the challenge on ultrasound beamforming with deep learning (CUBDL), which was offered as a component of the 2020 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium. We summarize the challenge results and present qualitative and quantitative assessments using both the initially closed CUBDL evaluation test dataset (which was crowd-sourced from multiple groups around the world) and additional in vivo breast ultrasound data contributed after the challenge was completed. As an example quantitative assessment, single plane wave images from the CUBDL Task 1 dataset produced a mean generalized contrast-to-noise ratio (gCNR) of 0.67 and a mean lateral resolution of 0.42 mm when formed with delay-and-sum beamforming, compared with a mean gCNR as high as 0.81 and a mean lateral resolution as low as 0.32 mm when formed with networks submitted by the challenge winners. We also describe contributed CUBDL data that may be used for training of future networks. The compiled database includes a total of 576 image acquisition sequences. We additionally introduce a neural-network-based global sound speed estimator implementation that was necessary to fairly evaluate the results obtained with this international database. The integration of CUBDL evaluation methods, evaluation code, network weights from the challenge winners, and all datasets described herein are publicly available (visit https://cubdl.jhu.edu for details).",NA

The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the forefront a need for the scientific community to work even more cooperatively to effectively tackle a global health crisis. EMBL-EBI has been able to build on its position to contribute to the fight against COVID-19 in a number of ways. Firstly, EMBL-EBI has used its infrastructure, expertise and network of international collaborations to help build the European COVID-19 Data Platform (https://www.covid19dataportal.org/), which brings together COVID-19 biomolecular data and connects it to researchers, clinicians and public health professionals. By September 2020, the COVID-19 Data Platform has integrated in excess of 170 000 COVID-19 biomolecular data and literature records, collected through a number of EMBL-EBI resources. Secondly, EMBL-EBI has strived to continue its support of the life science communities through the crisis, with updated Training provision and improved service provision throughout its resources.

34019655,KEA3: improved kinase enrichment analysis via data integration.,"Phosphoproteomics and proteomics experiments capture a global snapshot of the cellular signaling network, but these methods do not directly measure kinase state. Kinase Enrichment Analysis 3 (KEA3) is a webserver application that infers overrepresentation of upstream kinases whose putative substrates are in a user-inputted list of proteins. KEA3 can be applied to analyze data from phosphoproteomics and proteomics studies to predict the upstream kinases responsible for observed differential phosphorylations. The KEA3 background database contains measured and predicted kinase-substrate interactions (KSI), kinase-protein interactions (KPI), and interactions supported by co-expression and co-occurrence data. To benchmark the performance of KEA3, we examined whether KEA3 can predict the perturbed kinase from single-kinase perturbation followed by gene expression experiments, and phosphoproteomics data collected from kinase-targeting small molecules. We show that integrating KSIs and KPIs across data sources to produce a composite ranking improves the recovery of the expected kinase.

33095860,CNCDatabase: a database of non-coding cancer drivers.,"Most mutations in cancer genomes occur in the non-coding regions with unknown impact on tumor development. Although the increase in the number of cancer whole-genome sequences has revealed numerous putative non-coding cancer drivers, their information is dispersed across multiple studies making it difficult to understand their roles in tumorigenesis of different cancer types. We have developed CNCDatabase, Cornell Non-coding Cancer driver Database (https://cncdatabase.med.cornell.edu/) that contains detailed information about predicted non-coding drivers at gene promoters, 5' and 3' UTRs (untranslated regions), enhancers, CTCF insulators and non-coding RNAs. CNCDatabase documents 1111 protein-coding genes and 90 non-coding RNAs with reported drivers in their non-coding regions from 32 cancer types by computational predictions of positive selection using whole-genome sequences; differential gene expression in samples with and without mutations; or another set of experimental validations including luciferase reporter assays and genome editing. The database can be easily modified and scaled as lists of non-coding drivers are revised in the community with larger whole-genome sequencing studies, CRISPR screens and further experimental validations.

34252924,DIAmeter: matching peptides to data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry data.,"<h4>Motivation</h4>Tandem mass spectrometry data acquired using data independent acquisition (DIA) is challenging to interpret because the data exhibits complex structure along both the mass-to-charge (m/z) and time axes. The most common approach to analyzing this type of data makes use of a library of previously observed DIA data patterns (a 'spectral library'), but this approach is expensive because the libraries do not typically generalize well across laboratories.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we propose DIAmeter, a search engine that detects peptides in DIA data using only a peptide sequence database. Although some existing library-free DIA analysis methods (i) support data generated using both wide and narrow isolation windows, (ii) detect peptides containing post-translational modifications, (iii) analyze data from a variety of instrument platforms and (iv) are capable of detecting peptides even in the absence of detectable signal in the survey (MS1) scan, DIAmeter is the only method that offers all four capabilities in a single tool.<h4>Availability and implementation</h4>The open source, Apache licensed source code is available as part of the Crux mass spectrometry analysis toolkit (http://crux.ms).<h4>Supplementary information</h4>Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.","Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA 98195, USA."

While some bacteria also possess the proteasome, most of them contain a simpler and more specialized homolog, the HslV protease. In recent years, three further homologs of the proteasome core subunits have been characterized in prokaryotes: Anbu, BPH, and connectase. With the inclusion of these members, the family of proteasome-like proteins now exhibits a range of architectural and functional forms, from the canonical proteasome, a barrel-shaped protease without pronounced intrinsic substrate specificity, to the monomeric connectase, a highly specific protein ligase. We employed systematic sequence searches to show that we have only seen the tip of the iceberg so far and that beyond the hitherto known proteasome homologs lies a wealth of distantly related, uncharacterized homologs. We describe a total of 22 novel proteasome homologs in bacteria and archaea. Using sequence and structure analysis, we analyze their evolutionary history and assess structural differences that may modulate their function.

Previous studies in rice (Oryza sativa) have focused mainly on the identification of GVs, whereas systematic functional annotation of GVs has not yet been performed. Here, we present a functional impact map of GVs in rice. We curated haplotype information for 17 397 026 GVs from sequencing data of 4726 rice accessions. We quantitatively evaluated the effects of missense mutations in coding regions in each haplotype based on the conservation of amino acid residues and obtained the effects of 918 848 non-redundant missense GVs. Furthermore, we generated high-quality chromatin accessibility (CA) data from six representative rice tissues and used these data to train deep convolutional neural network models to predict the impacts of 5 067 405 GVs for CA in regulatory regions. We characterized the functional properties and tissue specificity of the GV effects and found that large-effect GVs in coding and regulatory regions may be subject to selection in different directions. Finally, we demonstrated how the functional impact map could be used to prioritize causal variants in mapping populations. This impact map will be a useful resource for accelerating gene cloning and functional studies in rice, and can be freely queried in RiceVarMap V2.0 (http://ricevarmap.ncpgr.cn).","National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement, Hubei Hongshan Laboratory, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China."

33683565,"Health and longevity studies in C. elegans: the ""healthy worm database"" reveals strengths, weaknesses and gaps of test compound-based studies.","Several biogerontology databases exist that focus on genetic or gene expression data linked to health as well as survival, subsequent to compound treatments or genetic manipulations in animal models. However, none of these has yet collected experimental results of compound-related health changes. Since quality of life is often regarded as more valuable than length of life, we aim to fill this gap with the ""Healthy Worm Database"" ( http://healthy-worm-database.eu ). Literature describing health-related compound studies in the aging model Caenorhabditis elegans was screened, and data for 440 compounds collected. The database considers 189 publications describing 89 different phenotypes measured in 2995 different conditions. Besides enabling a targeted search for promising compounds for further investigations, this database also offers insights into the research field of studies on healthy aging based on a frequently used model organism. Some weaknesses of C. elegans-based aging studies, like underrepresented phenotypes, especially concerning cognitive functions, as well as the convenience-based use of young worms as the starting point for compound treatment or phenotype measurement are discussed. In conclusion, the database provides an anchor for the search for compounds affecting health, with a link to public databases, and it further highlights some potential shortcomings in current aging research.","Molecular Genetics Group, Institute of Biology, Humboldt University of Berlin, 10115, Berlin, Germany. nadine.saul@gmx.de."

33793824,Analysis of a photosynthetic cyanobacterium rich in internal membrane systems via gradient profiling by sequencing (Grad-seq).,"Although regulatory small RNAs have been reported in photosynthetic cyanobacteria, the lack of clear RNA chaperones involved in their regulation poses a conundrum. Here, we analyzed the full complement of cellular RNAs and proteins using gradient profiling by sequencing (Grad-seq) in Synechocystis 6803. Complexes with overlapping subunits such as the CpcG1-type versus the CpcL-type phycobilisomes or the PsaK1 versus PsaK2 photosystem I pre(complexes) could be distinguished, supporting the high quality of this approach. Clustering of the in-gradient distribution profiles followed by several additional criteria yielded a short list of potential RNA chaperones that include an YlxR homolog and a cyanobacterial homolog of the KhpA/B complex. The data suggest previously undetected complexes between accessory proteins and CRISPR-Cas systems, such as a Csx1-Csm6 ribonucleolytic defense complex. Moreover, the exclusive association of either RpoZ or 6S RNA with the core RNA polymerase complex and the existence of a reservoir of inactive sigma-antisigma complexes is suggested. The Synechocystis Grad-seq resource is available online at https://sunshine.biologie.uni-freiburg.de/GradSeqExplorer/ providing a comprehensive resource for the functional assignment of RNA-protein complexes and multisubunit protein complexes in a photosynthetic organism.","Genetics and Experimental Bioinformatics, Faculty of Biology, University of Freiburg, Schänzlestr. 1, 79104 Freiburg, Germany."
33382886,Creating a Metabolic Syndrome Research Resource using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. ,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is multifaceted. Risk factors include visceral adiposity, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, hypertension and environmental stimuli. MetS leads to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and stroke. Comparative studies, however, have identified heterogeneity in the pathology of MetS across groups though the etiology of these differences has yet to be elucidated. The Metabolic Syndrome Research Resource (MetSRR) described in this report is a curated database that provides access to MetS-associated biological and ancillary data and pools current and potential biomarkers of MetS extracted from relevant National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 1999-2016. Each potential biomarker was selected following the review of over 100 peer-reviewed articles. MetSRR includes 28 demographics, survey and known MetS-related variables, including 9 curated categorical variables and 42 potentially novel biomarkers. All measures are captured from over 90 000 individuals. This biocuration effort provides increased access to curated MetS-related data and will serve as a hypothesis-generating tool to aid in novel biomarker discovery. In addition, MetSRR provides the ability to generate and export ethnic group-/race-, sex- and age-specific curated datasets, thus broadening participation in research efforts to identify clinically evaluative MetS biomarkers for disparate populations. Although there are other databases, such as BioM2MetDisease, designed to explore metabolic diseases through analysis of miRNAs and disease phenotypes, MetSRR is the only MetS-specific database designed to explore etiology of MetS across groups, through the biocuration of demographic, biological samples and biometric data.

31799597,RNAactDrug: a comprehensive database of RNAs associated with drug sensitivity from multi-omics data.,"Drug sensitivity has always been at the core of individualized cancer chemotherapy. However, we have been overwhelmed by large-scale pharmacogenomic data in the era of next-generation sequencing technology, which makes it increasingly challenging for researchers, especially those without bioinformatic experience, to perform data integration, exploration and analysis. To bridge this gap, we developed RNAactDrug, a comprehensive database of RNAs associated with drug sensitivity from multi-omics data, which allows users to explore drug sensitivity and RNA molecule associations directly. It provides association data between drug sensitivity and RNA molecules including mRNAs, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) at four molecular levels (expression, copy number variation, mutation and methylation) from integrated analysis of three large-scale pharmacogenomic databases (GDSC, CellMiner and CCLE).

This can be especially true in cases such as Alzheimer's disease, where the access to biological samples, along with well-defined patient information can be challenging. Considering the inflammatory part of Alzheimer's disease, our aim was to examine the presence of antimicrobial and immunomodulatory peptides in human proteomic datasets deposited in the publicly available proteomics database ProteomeXchange (http://www.proteomexchange.org/). First, a unified, comprehensive human antimicrobial and immunomodulatory peptide database, containing all known human antimicrobial and immunomodulatory peptides was constructed and used along with the datasets containing high-quality proteomics data originating from the examination of Alzheimer's disease and control groups. A throughout network analysis was carried out, and the enriched GO functions were examined. Less than 1% of all identified proteins in the brain were antimicrobial and immunomodulatory peptides, but the alterations characteristic of Alzheimer's disease could be recapitulated with their analysis. Our data emphasize the key role of the innate immune system and blood clotting in the development of Alzheimer's disease. The central role of antimicrobial and immunomodulatory peptides suggests their utilization as potential targets for mechanistic studies and future therapies.","Proteomics Core Facility, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, Hungary."

Male rats were randomly split into groups (n = 6): (1) Control (corn oil); (2) DEHP (50 mg/kg b.w./day); (3) DBP (50 mg/kg b.w./day); (4) BPA (25 mg/kg b.w./day); and (5) MIX (50 mg/kg b.w./day DEHP + 50 mg/kg b.w/day DBP + 25 mg/kg b.w./day BPA). Animals were sacrificed after 28 days of oral exposure, testes were extracted and prepared for histological assessments under the light microscope (haematoxylin and eosin staining) and redox status analysis. The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD; http://CTD.mdibl.org), Cytoscape software (https://cytoscape.org) and ToppGene Suite (https://toppgene.cchmc.org) were used for data-mining. Present pathohistological study has demonstrated more pronounced testicular toxicity of the MIX group (desquamated germinal epithelium cells, enlarged cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, multinucleated cell forms and intracytoplasmic vacuoles) in comparison with the single substances, while effects on redox status parameters were either more prominent, or present only in the MIX group. In silico investigation revealed 20 genes linked to male reproductive disorders, affected by all three investigated substances.

34029142,Landscape of GPCR expression along the mouse nephron.,"Kidney transport and other renal functions are regulated by multiple G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) expressed along the renal tubule. The rapid, recent appearance of comprehensive unbiased gene expression data in the various renal tubule segments, chiefly RNA sequencing and protein mass spectrometry data, has provided a means of identifying patterns of GPCR expression along the renal tubule. To allow for comprehensive mapping, we first curated a comprehensive list of GPCRs in the genomes of mice, rats, and humans (https://hpcwebapps.cit.nih.gov/ESBL/Database/GPCRs/) using multiple online data sources. We used this list to mine segment-specific and cell type-specific expression data from RNA-sequencing studies in microdissected mouse tubule segments to identify GPCRs that are selectively expressed in discrete tubule segments. Comparisons of these mapped mouse GPCRs with other omics datasets as well as functional data from isolated perfused tubule and micropuncture studies confirmed patterns of expression for well-known receptors and identified poorly studied GPCRs that are likely to play roles in the regulation of renal tubule function. Thus, we provide data resources for GPCR expression across the renal tubule, highlighting both well-known GPCRs and understudied receptors to provide guidance for future studies.","Epithelial Systems Biology Laboratory, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland."

We show its unique advantages compared to existing databases and toolkits by effectively revealing cell type-specificity, identifying regulatory elements and 3D chromatin contacts, deciphering gene functional relationships, inferring functions of transcription factors, and unprecedentedly promoting single-cell data analyses. We anticipate OpenAnnotate will provide a promising avenue for researchers to construct a more holistic perspective to understand regulatory mechanisms.","Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Bioinformatics, Bioinformatics Division at the Beijing National Research Center for Information Science and Technology, Center for Synthetic and Systems Biology, Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."
33166149,Insights from the First Phosphopeptide Challenge of the MS Resource Pillar of the HUPO Human Proteome Project.,"Mass spectrometry has greatly improved the analysis of phosphorylation events in complex biological systems and on a large scale. Despite considerable progress, the correct identification of phosphorylated sites, their quantification, and their interpretation regarding physiological relevance remain challenging. The MS Resource Pillar of the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO) Human Proteome Project (HPP) initiated the Phosphopeptide Challenge as a resource to help the community evaluate methods, learn procedures and data analysis routines, and establish their own workflows by comparing results obtained from a standard set of 94 phosphopeptides (serine, threonine, tyrosine) and their nonphosphorylated counterparts mixed at different ratios in a neat sample and a yeast background. Participants analyzed both samples with their method(s) of choice to report the identification and site localization of these peptides, determine their relative abundances, and enrich for the phosphorylated peptides in the yeast background. We discuss the results from 22 laboratories that used a range of different methods, instruments, and analysis software. We reanalyzed submitted data with a single software pipeline and highlight the successes and challenges in correct phosphosite localization. All of the data from this collaborative endeavor are shared as a resource to encourage the development of even better methods and tools for diverse phosphoproteomic applications.

These are commonly found in all kingdoms of life, especially in eukaryotes and a larger fraction of human proteins composed of repeats. Further, the abnormal expansions of shorter repeats cause various diseases to humans. Therefore, the analysis of repeats of the entire human proteome along with functional, mutational and disease information would help to better understand their roles in proteins. To fulfill this need, we developed a web database HPREP (http://bioinfo.bdu.ac.in/hprep) for human proteome repeats using Perl and HTML programming. We identified different categories of well-characterized repeats and domain repeats that are present in the human proteome of UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot by using in-house Perl programming and novel repeats by using the repeat detection T-REKS tool as well as XSTREAM web server. Further, these proteins are annotated with functional, mutational and disease information and grouped according to specific repeat types. The developed database enables the users to search by specific repeat type in order to understand their involvement in proteins.

Each entry in the database contains relevant background information on how the data was compiled as well as the total energy of each molecular system and interfragment interaction energy (IFIE) and pair interaction energy decomposition analysis (PIEDA) values. Currently, the database contains more than 13 600 FMO calculation data sets, and a comprehensive search function implemented at the front-end. The procedure for selecting target proteins, preprocessing the experimental structures, construction of the database, and details of the database front-end were described. Then, we demonstrated a use of the FMODB by comparing IFIE value distributions of hydrogen bond, ion-pair, and XH/π interactions obtained by FMO method to those by molecular mechanics approach. From the comparison, the statistical analysis of the data provided standard reference values for the three types of interactions that will be useful for determining whether each interaction in a given system is relatively strong or weak compared to the interactions contained within the data in the FMODB. In the final part, we demonstrate the use of the database to examine the contribution of halogen atoms to the binding affinity between human cathepsin L and its inhibitors. We found that the electrostatic term derived by PIEDA greatly correlated with the binding affinities of the halogen containing cathepsin L inhibitors, indicating the importance of QM calculation for quantitative analysis of halogen interactions. Thus, the FMO calculation data in FMODB will be useful for conducting statistical analyses to drug discovery, for conducting molecular recognition studies in structural biology, and for other studies involving quantum mechanics-based interactions.","RIKEN Center for Biosystems Dynamics Research, 1-7-22 Suehiro-cho Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama, Kanagawa 230-0045, Japan."

33121433,circVAR database: genome-wide archive of genetic variants for human circular RNAs.,"<h4>Background</h4>Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play important roles in regulating gene expression through binding miRNAs and RNA binding proteins. Genetic variation of circRNAs may affect complex traits/diseases by changing their binding efficiency to target miRNAs and proteins. There is a growing demand for investigations of the functions of genetic changes using large-scale experimental evidence. However, there is no online genetic resource for circRNA genes.<h4>Results</h4>We performed extensive genetic annotation of 295,526 circRNAs integrated from circBase, circNet and circRNAdb. All pre-computed genetic variants were presented at our online resource, circVAR, with data browsing and search functionality. We explored the chromosome-based distribution of circRNAs and their associated variants. We found that, based on mapping to the 1000 Genomes and ClinVAR databases, chromosome 17 has a relatively large number of circRNAs and associated common and health-related genetic variants. Following the annotation of genome wide association studies (GWAS)-based circRNA variants, we found many non-coding variants within circRNAs, suggesting novel mechanisms for common diseases reported from GWAS studies.

33877858,Developing a Flexible National Wastewater Surveillance System for COVID-19 and Beyond.,"<h4>Background</h4>Wastewater testing offers a cost-effective strategy for measuring population disease prevalence and health behaviors. For COVID-19, wastewater surveillance addresses testing gaps and provides an early warning for outbreaks. As U.S. federal agencies build a National Wastewater Surveillance System around the pandemic, thinking through ways to develop flexible frameworks for wastewater sampling, testing, and reporting can avoid unnecessary system overhauls for future infectious disease, chronic disease, and drug epidemics.<h4>Objectives</h4>We discuss ways to transform a historically academic exercise into a tool for epidemic response. We generalize lessons learned by a global network of wastewater researchers around validation and implementation for COVID-19 and opioids while also drawing on our experience with wastewater-based epidemiology in the United States.<h4>Discussion</h4>Sustainable wastewater surveillance requires coordination between health and safety officials, utilities, labs, and researchers. Adapting sampling frequency, type, and location to threat level, community vulnerability, biomarker properties, and decisions that wastewater data will inform can increase the practical value of the data. Marketplace instabilities, coupled with a fragmented testing landscape due to specialization, may require officials to engage multiple labs to test for known and unknown threats. Government funding can stabilize the market, balancing commercial pressures with public good, and incentivize data sharing. When reporting results, standardizing metrics and contextualizing wastewater data with health resource data can provide insights into a community's vulnerability and identify strategies to prevent health care systems from being overwhelmed. If wastewater data will inform policy decisions for an entire community, comparing characteristics of the wastewater treatment plant's service population to those of the larger community can help determine whether the wastewater data are generalizable. Ethical protocols may be needed to protect privacy and avoid stigmatization. With data-driven approaches to sample collection, analysis, and interpretation, officials can use wastewater surveillance for adaptive resource allocation, pandemic management, and program evaluation. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP8572.","Mathematica, Princeton, New Jersey, USA."

33724838,MaCPepDB: A Database to Quickly Access All Tryptic Peptides of the UniProtKB.,"Protein sequence databases play a crucial role in the majority of the currently applied mass-spectrometry-based proteomics workflows. Here UniProtKB serves as one of the major sources, as it combines the information of several smaller databases and enriches the entries with additional biological information. For the identification of peptides in a sample by tandem mass spectra, as generated by data-dependent acquisition, protein sequence databases provide the basis for most spectrum identification search engines. In addition, for targeted proteomics approaches like selected reaction monitoring (SRM) and parallel reaction monitoring (PRM), knowledge of the peptide sequences, their masses, and whether they are unique for a protein is essential. Because most bottom-up proteomics approaches use trypsin to cleave the proteins in a sample, the tryptic peptides contained in a protein database are of great interest. We present a database, called MaCPepDB (mass-centric peptide database), that consists of the complete tryptic digest of the Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL parts of UniProtKB. This database is especially designed to not only allow queries of peptide sequences and return the respective information about connected proteins and thus whether a peptide is unique but also allow queries of specific masses of peptides or precursors of MS/MS spectra. Furthermore, posttranslational modifications can be considered in a query as well as different mass deviations for posttranslational modifications. Hence the database can be used by a sequence query not only to, for example, check in which proteins of the UniProt database a tryptic peptide can be found but also to find possibly interfering peptides in PRM/SRM experiments using the mass query. The complete database contains currently 5 939 244 990 peptides from 185 561 610 proteins (UniProt version 2020_03), for which a single query usually takes less than 1 s.

33166383,FireProtDB: database of manually curated protein stability data.,"The majority of naturally occurring proteins have evolved to function under mild conditions inside the living organisms. One of the critical obstacles for the use of proteins in biotechnological applications is their insufficient stability at elevated temperatures or in the presence of salts. Since experimental screening for stabilizing mutations is typically laborious and expensive, in silico predictors are often used for narrowing down the mutational landscape. The recent advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence further facilitate the development of such computational tools. However, the accuracy of these predictors strongly depends on the quality and amount of data used for training and testing, which have often been reported as the current bottleneck of the approach. To address this problem, we present a novel database of experimental thermostability data for single-point mutants FireProtDB. The database combines the published datasets, data extracted manually from the recent literature, and the data collected in our laboratory. Its user interface is designed to facilitate both types of the expected use: (i) the interactive explorations of individual entries on the level of a protein or mutation and (ii) the construction of highly customized and machine learning-friendly datasets using advanced searching and filtering.

34349739,Beyond Taxonomic Identification: Integration of Ecological Responses to a Soil Bacterial 16S rRNA Gene Database.,"High-throughput sequencing 16S rRNA gene surveys have enabled new insights into the diversity of soil bacteria, and furthered understanding of the ecological drivers of abundances across landscapes. However, current analytical approaches are of limited use in formalizing syntheses of the ecological attributes of taxa discovered, because derived taxonomic units are typically unique to individual studies and sequence identification databases only characterize taxonomy. To address this, we used sequences obtained from a large nationwide soil survey (GB Countryside Survey, henceforth CS) to create a comprehensive soil specific 16S reference database, with coupled ecological information derived from survey metadata. Specifically, we modeled taxon responses to soil pH at the OTU level using hierarchical logistic regression (HOF) models, to provide information on both the shape of landscape scale pH-abundance responses, and pH optima (pH at which OTU abundance is maximal). We identify that most of the soil OTUs examined exhibited a non-flat relationship with soil pH. Further, the pH optima could not be generalized by broad taxonomy, highlighting the need for tools and databases synthesizing ecological traits at finer taxonomic resolution. We further demonstrate the utility of the database by testing against geographically dispersed query 16S datasets; evaluating efficacy by quantifying matches, and accuracy in predicting pH responses of query sequences from a separate large soil survey. We found that the CS database provided good coverage of dominant taxa; and that the taxa indicating soil pH in a query dataset corresponded with the pH classifications of top matches in the CS database. Furthermore we were able to predict query dataset community structure, using predicted abundances of dominant taxa based on query soil pH data and the HOF models of matched CS database taxa. The database with associated HOF model outputs is released as an online portal for querying single sequences of interest (https://shiny-apps.ceh.ac.uk/ID-TaxER/), and flat files are made available for use in bioinformatic pipelines. The further development of advanced informatics infrastructures incorporating modeled ecological attributes along with new functional genomic information will likely facilitate large scale exploration and prediction of soil microbial functional biodiversity under current and future environmental change scenarios.","UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Bangor, United Kingdom."

However, valuable software is in this context not only defined by a powerful algorithm to separate correct from false identifications, but also by constant maintenance and continuous improvements.<h4>Methods</h4>In 2014, we presented our peptide identification algorithm MS Amanda, showing its suitability for identifying peptides in high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry data and its ability to outperform widely used tools to identify peptides. Since then, we have continuously worked on improvements to enhance its usability and to support new trends and developments in this fast-growing field, while keeping the original scoring algorithm to assess the quality of a peptide spectrum match unchanged.<h4>Results</h4>We present the outcome of these efforts, MS Amanda 2.0, a faster and more flexible standalone version with the original scoring algorithm. The new implementation has led to a 3-5× speedup, is able to handle new ion types and supports standard data formats. We also show that MS Amanda 2.0 works best when using only the most common ion types in a particular search instead of all possible ion types.<h4>Conclusions</h4>MS Amanda is available free of charge from https://ms.imp.ac.at/index.php?action=msamanda.","Bioinformatics Research Group, University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria, Softwarepark 11, 4232 Hagenberg, Austria."
32324748,OdoBD: An online database for the dragonflies and damselflies of Bangladesh.,"Combining scientific data over a long-time period is necessary for generating large-scale datasets, which are an essential component of comparative analysis for understanding evolutionary processes. Furthermore, monitoring temporal and spatial distributions of animals at a global and regional scale is essential for studying climate change driven extinction risks. Regional and global datasets focusing on different animal groups are on the rise to meet such challenges. Although being one of the earliest and best-known insect groups, the data on Odonata remains rudimentary and dispersed, especially in the South Asian region. Bangladesh, being located within a biodiversity hotspot, possesses a large number of odonate species and many of them are endemic to the South Asian region. We have developed an online database for the Odonata of Bangladesh by compiling and digitizing data from our last four years of field studies, from previously published research articles and field guides, and also by collecting data from citizen scientists. The Odonata of Bangladesh database (accessible at http://www.odobd.org) contains phenotypic, genotypic, photographic, taxonomic, biogeographic and faunistic data of the Odonata of Bangladesh. The database will be a valuable resource for understanding diversity, distributions, extinction risks and conservation planning of the Odonata of Bangladesh. Finally, phenotypic, spatial and temporal data of Odonata of Bangladesh datasets can be integrated with other regional datasets for analyzing macroevolutionary trends and to monitor the effect of climate change on odonates.","Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Sylhet, Bangladesh."

These databases can be very large, containing millions of sequences, which reduces the sensitivity of matching tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data to sequences to generate peptide spectrum matches (PSMs). Here, we describe and evaluate a sectioning method for generating an enriched database for those protein sequences that are most likely present in the sample. Our evaluation demonstrates how this method helps to increase the sensitivity of PSMs while maintaining acceptable false discovery rate statistics-offering a flexible alternative to traditional large database searching, as well as previously described two-step database searching methods for large sequence database applications. Furthermore, implementation in the Galaxy platform provides access to an automated and customizable workflow for carrying out the method.

Given a flat list of proteins, its aim is to organize it in terms of structural interactions to provide a clearer overview of the data. This is achieved using three means: (i) the search for interologs with resolved structure available in the protein data bank, including cross-species remote homology search, (ii) the search for possibly weaker interactions mediated through Short Linear Motifs as predicted by ELM-a unique feature of Proteo3Dnet, (iii) the search for protein-protein interactions physically validated in the BioGRID database. The server then compiles this information and returns a graph of the identified interactions and details about the different searches. The graph can be interactively explored to understand the way the core complexes identified could interact. It can also suggest undetected partners to the experimentalists, or specific cases of conditionally exclusive binding.

Its high medicinal value has long been recognized by traditional Chinese medicine (as <i>Radix paeoniae Alba</i> and <i>Radix paeoniae Rubra</i>), and it has become economically valued for its oilseed in recent years; like other <i>Paeonia</i> species, it has been identified as a novel resource for the α-linolenic acid used in seed oil production. However, its genome has not yet been sequenced, and little transcriptome data on <i>Paeonia lactiflora</i> are available. To obtain a comprehensive transcriptome for <i>Paeonia lactiflora</i>, RNAs from 10 tissues of the <i>Paeonia lactiflora</i> Pall. cv Shaoyou17C were used for <i>de novo</i> assembly, and 416,062 unigenes were obtained. Using a homology search, it was found that 236,222 (approximately 57%) unigenes had at least one BLAST hit in one or more public data resources. The construction of co-expression networks is a feasible means for improving unigene annotation. Using in-house transcriptome data, we obtained a co-expression network covering 95.13% of the unigenes. Then we integrated co-expression network analyses and lipid-related pathway genes to study lipid metabolism in <i>Paeonia lactiflora</i> cultivars. Finally, we constructed the online database HpeNet (http://bioinformatics.cau.edu.cn/HpeNet) to integrate transcriptome data, gene information, the co-expression network, and so forth. The database can also be searched for gene details, gene functions, orthologous matches, and other data. Our online database may help the research community identify functional genes and perform research on <i>Paeonia lactiflora</i> more conveniently.

33719338,Construction of circRNA-Based ceRNA Network to Reveal the Role of circRNAs in the Progression and Prognosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"<h4>Background</h4>Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are now under hot discussion as novel promising biomarkers for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The purpose of our study is to identify several competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks related to the prognosis and progression of HCC and to further investigate the mechanism of their influence on tumor progression.<h4>Methods</h4>First, we obtained gene expression data related to liver cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database (http://www.portal.gdc.cancer.gov/), including microRNA (miRNA) sequence, RNA sequence, and clinical information. A co-expression network was constructed through the Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) software package in R software. The differentially expressed messenger RNAs (DEmRNAs) in the key module were analyzed with the Database for Annotation Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/summary.jsp) to perform functional enrichment analysis including Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO). The data of miRNA expression and clinical information downloaded from TCGA were utilized for survival analysis to detach the prognostic value of the DEmiRNAs of the key module.<h4>Results</h4>The 201 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs) and 3,783 DEmRNAs were preliminarily identified through differential expression analysis. The co-expression networks of DEmiRNAs and DEmRNAs were constructed with WGCNA. Further analysis confirmed four miRNAs in the most significant module (blue module) were associated with the overall survival (OS) of patients with liver cancer, including hsa-miR-92b-3p, hsa-miR-122-3p, hsa-miR-139-5p, and hsa-miR-7850-5p. DAVID was used for functional enrichment analysis of 286 co-expressed mRNAs. The GO analysis results showed that the top enriched GO terms were oxidation-reduction process, extracellular exosome, and iron ion binding. In KEGG pathway analysis, the top three enriched terms included metabolic pathways, fatty acid degradation, and valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation. In addition, we intersected the miRNA-mRNA interaction prediction results with the differentially expressed and prognostic mRNAs. We found that hsa-miR-92b-3p can be related to CPEB3 and ACADL. By overlapping the data of predicted circRNAs by circBank and differentially expressed circRNAs of GSE94508, we screened has_circ_0077210 as the upstream regulatory molecule of hsa-miR-92b-3p. Hsa_circ_0077210/hsa-miR-92b-3p/cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein-3 (CPEB3) and acyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase, long chain (ACADL) were validated in HCC tissue.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Our research provides a mechanistic elucidation of the unknown ceRNA regulatory network in HCC. Hsa_circ_0077210 might serve a momentous therapeutic role to restrain the occurrence and development of HCC.","Department of General Surgery, Jiangsu Cancer Hospital & Jiangsu Institute of Cancer Research, The Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Nanjing, China."
34046592,A map of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA structurome.,"SARS-CoV-2 has exploded throughout the human population. To facilitate efforts to gain insights into SARS-CoV-2 biology and to target the virus therapeutically, it is essential to have a roadmap of likely functional regions embedded in its RNA genome. In this report, we used a bioinformatics approach, ScanFold, to deduce the <i>local</i> RNA structural landscape of the SARS-CoV-2 genome with the highest likelihood of being functional. We recapitulate previously-known elements of RNA structure and provide a model for the folding of an essential frameshift signal. Our results find that SARS-CoV-2 is greatly enriched in unusually stable and likely evolutionarily ordered RNA structure, which provides a large reservoir of potential drug targets for RNA-binding small molecules. Results are enhanced via the re-analyses of publicly-available genome-wide biochemical structure probing datasets that are broadly in agreement with our models. Additionally, ScanFold was updated to incorporate experimental data as constraints in the analysis to facilitate comparisons between ScanFold and other RNA modelling approaches. Ultimately, ScanFold was able to identify eight highly structured/conserved motifs in SARS-CoV-2 that agree with experimental data, without explicitly using these data.

34325658,Taxallnomy: an extension of NCBI Taxonomy that produces a hierarchically complete taxonomic tree.,"<h4>Background</h4>NCBI Taxonomy is the main taxonomic source for several bioinformatics tools and databases since all organisms with sequence accessions deposited on INSDC are organized in its hierarchical structure. Despite the extensive use and application of this data source, an alternative representation of data as a table would facilitate the use of information for processing bioinformatics data. To do so, since some taxonomic-ranks are missing in some lineages, an algorithm might propose provisional names for all taxonomic-ranks.<h4>Results</h4>To address this issue, we developed an algorithm that takes the tree structure from NCBI Taxonomy and generates a hierarchically complete taxonomic table, maintaining its compatibility with the original tree. The procedures performed by the algorithm consist of attempting to assign a taxonomic-rank to an existing clade or ""no rank"" node when possible, using its name as part of the created taxonomic-rank name (e.g. Ord_Ornithischia) or interpolating parent nodes when needed (e.g. Cla_of_Ornithischia), both examples given for the dinosaur Brachylophosaurus lineage. The new hierarchical structure was named Taxallnomy because it contains names for all taxonomic-ranks, and it contains 41 hierarchical levels corresponding to the 41 taxonomic-ranks currently found in the NCBI Taxonomy database. From Taxallnomy, users can obtain the complete taxonomic lineage with 41 nodes of all taxa available in the NCBI Taxonomy database, without any hazard to the original tree information. In this work, we demonstrate its applicability by embedding taxonomic information of a specified rank into a phylogenetic tree and by producing metagenomics profiles.<h4>Conclusion</h4>Taxallnomy applies to any bioinformatics analyses that depend on the information from NCBI Taxonomy. Taxallnomy is updated periodically but with a distributed PERL script users can generate it locally using NCBI Taxonomy as input.

34263466,Prediction of overall survival in patients with Stage I esophageal cancer: A novel web-based calculator.,"<h4>Background and aims</h4>In this study, we aimed to develop a convenient web-based calculator to predict the overall survival (OS) of patients with Stage I esophageal cancer (EC).<h4>Methods</h4>Data of 1664 patients, between 2004 and 2015, were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression was employed to sift variables; subsequently, Cox proportional hazards regression model was built. We applied the enhanced bootstrap validation to appraise the discrimination and calibration of the model. Clinical benefit was measured using decision curve analysis (DCA). Thereafter, a web-based calculator based on the model, which could be used to predict the 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS rates, was developed.<h4>Results</h4>Race, age, histologic type, grade, N stage, and therapeutic methods were selected. C-indices of the prediction model in the training and validation groups were 0.726 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.679-0.773) and 0.724 (95% CI, 0.679-0.769), respectively. Calibration curves showed good agreement between the groups. The DCA demonstrated that the prediction model is clinically useful.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The prediction model we developed showed a good performance in calculating the OS rates in patients with Stage I EC.

34252246,Exploring Curated Conformational Ensembles of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins in the Protein Ensemble Database.,"The Protein Ensemble Database (PED; https://proteinensemble.org/) is the major repository of conformational ensembles of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Conformational ensembles of IDPs are primarily provided by their authors or occasionally collected from literature, and are subsequently deposited in PED along with the corresponding structured, manually curated metadata. The modeling of conformational ensembles usually relies on experimental data from small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), NMR spectroscopy, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, or a combination of these techniques. The growing number of scientific studies based on these data, along with the astounding and swift progress in the field of protein intrinsic disorder, has required a significant update and upgrade of PED, first published in 2014. To this end, the database was entirely renewed in 2020 and now has a dedicated team of biocurators providing manually curated descriptions of the methods and conditions applied to generate the conformational ensembles and for checking consistency of the data. Here, we present a detailed description on how to explore PED with its protein pages and experimental pages, and how to interpret entries of conformational ensembles.

It always results from exposure to drugs or environmental chemicals that cause the impairment and degeneration of the inner ear. Herein, we focused on the in silico modeling of drug-induced ototoxicity of chemicals. We collected 1,102 ototoxic medications and 1,705 non-ototoxic drugs. Based on the data set, a series of computational models were developed with different traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms implemented on an online chemical database and modeling environment. Six ML models performed best on 5-fold cross-validation and test set. A consensus model was developed with the best individual models. These models were further validated with an external validation. The consensus model showed best predictive ability, with high accuracy of 0.95 on test set and 0.90 on validation set. The consensus model and the data sets used for model development are available at https://ochem.eu/model/46566321.

33110585,Rapid response to the COVID-19 pandemic: Vietnam government's experience and preliminary success.,"<h4>Background</h4>The COVID-19 pandemic has hit all corners of the world, challenging governments to act promptly in controlling the spread of the pandemic. Due to limited resources and inferior technological capacities, developing countries including Vietnam have faced many challenges in combating the pandemic. Since the first cases were detected on 23 January 2020, Vietnam has undergone a 3-month fierce battle to control the outbreak with stringent measures from the government to mitigate the adverse impacts. In this study, we aim to give insights into the Vietnamese government's progress during the first three months of the outbreak. Additionally, we relatively compare Vietnam's response with that of other Southeast Asia countries to deliver a clear and comprehensive view on disease control strategies.<h4>Methods</h4>The data on the number of COVID-19 confirmed and recovered cases in Vietnam was obtained from the Dashboard for COVID-19 statistics of the Ministry of Health (https://ncov.vncdc.gov.vn/). The review on Vietnam's country-level responses was conducted by searching for relevant government documents issued on the online database 'Vietnam Laws Repository' (https://thuvienphapluat.vn/en/index.aspx), with the grey literature on Google and relevant official websites. A stringency index of government policies and the countries' respective numbers of confirmed cases of nine Southeast Asian countries were adapted from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/coronavirus-government-response-tracker). All data was updated as of 24 April 2020.<h4>Results</h4>Preliminary positive results have been achieved given that the nation confirmed no new community-transmitted cases since 16 April and zero COVID-19 - related deaths throughout the 3-month pandemic period. To date, the pandemic has been successfully controlled thanks to the Vietnamese government's prompt, proactive and decisive responses including mobilization of the health care systems, security forces, economic policies, along with a creative and effective communication campaign corresponding with crucial milestones of the epidemic's progression.<h4>Conclusions</h4>Vietnam could be one of the role models in pandemic control for low-resource settings.

33359127,NBIGV-DB: A dedicated database of non-B cell derived immunoglobulin variable region.,"Immunoglobulins (Ig) are important immune molecules that possess highly diverse variable region sequences enabling antigen recognition. According to classical immune theory, B lymphocytes have been considered the only source of Ig production (B-Igs). However, accumulating evidence have suggested that Igs are also produced by many non-B cells (non-B Igs), including epithelial cells, neurons, germ cells, as well as myeloid cells of hemopoietic system. Besides acting as bona fide antibodies, Non-B Igs have alternative cellular functions, such as promotion of cell survival, adhesion and migration. More importantly, Unlike the unlimited sequence diversity of B-Igs, the non-B Igs exhibit conserved V(D)J patterns across the same lineages. To support the analysis and comparison of variable region sequences from Igs, produced by B and non-B cells, we established a database (NBIGV) constituted by a non-B Ig variable region repertoire, which includes 727,989 V<sub>H</sub>DJ<sub>H</sub> and VκJκ recombination sequences of non-B Igs sequenced from mouse samples. Upon database search, users can view, browse and investigate the variable region sequences of non-B Igs according to respective mice strains and tissues as well as Ig classes.

The main feature in this version is the inclusion of newly sequenced genotypes and their meta-information, giving a total of 217 accessions of 19 wild Oryza species (O. rufipogon, O. barthii, O. longistaminata, O. meridionalis, O. glumaepatula, O. punctata, O. minuta, O. officinalis, O. rhizomatis, O. eichingeri, O. latifolia, O. alta, O. grandiglumis, O. australiensis, O. brachyantha, O. granulata, O. meyeriana, O. ridleyi, and O. longiglumis). These 19 wild species belong to 9 genome types (AA, BB, CC, BBCC, CCDD, EE, FF, GG, and HHJJ), representing wide genomic diversity in the genus. Using the genotype information, we analyzed the genome diversity of Oryza species. Other features of OryzaGenome facilitate the use of information on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between O. sativa and its wild progenitor O. rufipogon in rice research, including breeding as well as basic science. For example, we provide Variant Call Format (VCF) files for genome-wide SNPs of 33 O. rufipogon accessions against the O. sativa reference genome, IRGSP1.0. In addition, we provide a new SNP Effect Table function, allowing users to identify SNPs or small insertion/deletion polymorphisms in the 33 O. rufipogon accessions and to search for the effect of these polymorphisms on protein function if they reside in the coding region (e.g., are missense or nonsense mutations). Furthermore, the SNP Viewer for 446 O. rufipogon accessions was updated by implementing new tracks for possible selective sweep regions and highly mutated regions that were potentially exposed to selective pressures during the process of domestication.<h4>Conclusion</h4>OryzaGenome2.1 focuses on comparative genomic analysis of diverse wild Oryza accessions collected around the world and on the development of resources to speed up the identification of critical trait-related genes, especially from O. rufipogon. It aims to promote the use of genotype information from wild accessions in rice breeding and potential future crop improvements.

32436344,Update of the CLRP TG-43 parameter database for low-energy brachytherapy sources.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>To update the Carleton Laboratory for Radiotherapy Physics (CLRP) TG-43 dosimetry database for low-energy (≤50 keV) photon-emitting low-dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy sources utilizing the open-source EGSnrc application egs_brachy rather than the BrachyDose application used previously for 27 LDR sources in the 2008 CLRP version (CLRPv1). CLRPv2 covers 40 sources ( 103 Pd, 125 I, and 131 Cs). A comprehensive set of TG-43 parameters is calculated, including dose-rate constants, radial dose functions with functional fitting parameters, 1D and 2D anisotropy functions, along-away dose-rate tables, Primary-Scatter separation dose tables (for some sources), and mean photon energies at the surface of the sources. The database also documents the source models which will become part of the egs_brachy distribution.<h4>Acquisition and validation methods</h4>Datasets are calculated after a systematic recoding of the source geometries using the egs++ geometry package and its egs_brachy extensions. Air-kerma strength per history is calculated for models of NIST's Wide-Angle Free-Air chamber (WAFAC) and for a point detector located at 10 cm on the source's transverse axis. Full scatter water phantoms with varying voxel resolutions in cylindrical coordinates are used for dose calculations. New statistical uncertainties of source volume corrections for phantom voxels which overlap with brachytherapy sources are implemented in egs_brachy, and all CLRPv2 data include these uncertainties. For validation, data are compared to CLRPv1 and other data in the literature.<h4>Data format and access</h4>Data are available at https://physics.carleton.ca/clrp/egs_brachy/seed_database_v2, http://doi.org/10.22215/clrp/tg43v2. As well as being presented graphically in comparisons to previous calculations, data are available in Excel (.xlsx) spreadsheets for each source.<h4>Potential applications</h4>The database has applications in research, dosimetry, and brachytherapy treatment planning. This comprehensive update provides the medical physics community with more accurate TG-43 dose evaluation parameters, as well as fully benchmarked and described source models which are distributed with egs_brachy.","Carleton Laboratory for Radiotherapy Physics (CLRP), Department of Physics, Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, K1S 5B6, Canada."
33843105,Sequence and evolutionary analysis of bacterial ribosomal S1 proteins.,"The multi-domain bacterial S1 protein is the largest and most functionally important ribosomal protein of the 30S subunit, which interacts with both mRNA and proteins. The family of ribosomal S1 proteins differs in the classical sense from a protein with tandem repeats and has a ""bead-on-string"" organization, where each repeat is folded into a globular domain. Based on our recent data, the study of evolutionary relationships for the bacterial phyla will provide evidence for one of the proposed theories of the evolutionary development of proteins with structural repeats: from multiple repeats of assembles to single repeats, or vice versa. In this comparative analysis of 1333 S1 sequences that were identified in 24 different phyla, we demonstrate how such phyla can form independently/dependently during evolution. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first study of the evolutionary history of bacterial ribosomal S1 proteins. The collected and structured data can be useful to computer biologists as a resource for determining percent identity, amino acid composition and logo motifs, as well as dN/dS ratio in bacterial S1 protein. The obtained research data indicate that the evolutionary development of bacterial ribosomal S1 proteins evolved from multiple assemblies to single repeat.

With the release of the reference genome of the tea plant (Camellia sinensis) and the development of transcriptome sequencing, researchers have reported the existence of AS in tea plants. However, there is a lack of a platform, centered on different RNA-seq datasets, that provides comprehensive information on AS.To facilitate access to information on AS and reveal the molecular function of AS in tea plants, we established the first comprehensive AS database for tea plants (TeaAS, http://www.teaas.cn/index.php ). In this study, 3.96 Tb reads from 66 different RNA-seq datasets were collected to identify AS events. TeaAS supports four methods of retrieval of AS information based on gene ID, gene name, annotation (non-redundant/Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes/gene ontology annotation or chromosomal location) and RNA-seq data. It integrates data pertaining to genome annotation, type of AS event, transcript sequence, and isoforms expression levels from 66 RNA-seq datasets. The AS events resulting from different environmental conditions and that occurring in varied tissue types, and the expression levels of specific transcripts can be clearly identified through this online database. Moreover, it also provides two useful tools, Basic Local Alignment Search Tool and Generic Genome Browser, for sequence alignment and visualization of gene structure.The features of the TeaAS database make it a comprehensive AS bioinformatics platform for researchers, as well as a reference for studying AS events in woody crops. It could also be helpful for revealing the novel biological functions of AS in gene regulation in tea plants.","State Key Laboratory of Tea Plant Biology and Utilization, Anhui Agricultural University, West 130 Changjiang Road, Hefei, Anhui, 230036, People's Republic of China."

This review discusses the 106 allergens that were accepted by the Allergen Nomenclature Sub-Committee between 01/2019 and 03/2021. Information about protein family membership, patient cohorts, and assays used for allergen characterization is summarized. A first allergenic fungal triosephosphate isomerase, Asp t 36, was discovered in Aspergillus terreus. Plant allergens contained 1 contact, 38 respiratory, and 16 food allergens. Can s 4 from Indian hemp was identified as the first allergenic oxygen-evolving enhancer protein 2 and Cic a 1 from chickpeas as the first allergenic group 4 late embryogenesis abundant protein. Among the animal allergens were 19 respiratory, 28 food, and 3 venom allergens. Important discoveries include Rap v 2, an allergenic paramyosin in molluscs, and Sal s 4 and Pan h 4, allergenic fish tropomyosins. Paramyosins and tropomyosins were previously known mainly as arthropod allergens. Collagens from barramundi, Lat c 6, and salmon, Sal s 6, were the first members from the collagen superfamily added to the database.

As a result, biological information created at great expense is significantly underutilised. The protein motif biology field does not have sufficient resources to curate the corpus of motif-related literature and, to date, only a fraction of the available articles have been curated. In this study, we develop a set of tools and a web resource, 'articles.ELM', to rapidly identify the motif literature articles pertinent to a researcher's interest. At the core of the resource is a manually curated set of about 8000 motif-related articles. These articles are automatically annotated with a range of relevant biological data allowing in-depth search functionality. Machine-learning article classification is used to group articles based on their similarity to manually curated motif classes in the Eukaryotic Linear Motif resource. Articles can also be manually classified within the resource. The 'articles.ELM' resource permits the rapid and accurate discovery of relevant motif articles thereby improving the visibility of motif literature and simplifying the recovery of valuable biological insights sequestered within scientific articles.

The NHID contains information on demographic and medical service utilization for approximately 99% of the Korean population. This study targeted 3 major allergic diseases, including allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and asthma. For the target diseases, our database provides daily medical service information, including the number of daily visits from 2013 and 2017, categorized by patients' characteristics such as address, sex, age, and duration of residence. We provide additional information, including yearly population, a number of patients, and averaged geocoding coordinates by eup, myeon, and dong district code (the smallest-scale administrative units in Korea). This information enables researchers to analyze how daily changes in the environmental factors of allergic diseases (e.g., particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, and ozone) in certain regions would influence patients' behavioral patterns of medical service utilization. Moreover, researchers can analyze long-term trends in allergic diseases and the health effects caused by environmental factors such as daily climate and pollution data. The advantages of this database are easy access to data, additional levels of geographic detail, time-efficient data-refining and processing, and a de-identification process that minimizes the exposure of identifiable personal information.

33952239,Use of electronic pharmacy transaction data and website development to assess antibiotic use in nursing homes.,"<h4>Background</h4>In 2017, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services required all long-term care facilities, including nursing homes, to have an antibiotic stewardship program. Many nursing homes lack the resources, expertise, or infrastructure to track and analyze antibiotic use measures. Here, we demonstrate that pharmacy invoices are a viable source of data to track and report antibiotic use in nursing homes.<h4>Methods</h4>The dispensing pharmacy working with several nursing homes in the same healthcare corporation provided pharmacy invoices from 2014 to 2016 as files formatted as comma separated values. We aggregated these files by aligning elements into a consistent set of variables and assessed the completeness of data from each nursing home over time. Data cleaning involved removing rows that did not describe systemic medications, de-duplication, consolidating prescription refills, and removing prescriptions for insulin and opioids, which are medications that were not administered at a regular dose or schedule. After merging this cleaned invoice data to nursing home census data including bed days of care and publicly available data characterizing bed allocation for each nursing home, we used the resulting database to describe several antibiotic use metrics and generated an interactive website to permit further analysis.<h4>Results</h4>The resultant database permitted assessment of the following antibiotic use metrics: days of antibiotic therapy, length of antibiotic therapy, rate of antibiotic starts, and the antibiotic spectrum index. Further, we created a template for summarizing data within a facility and comparing across facilities. https://sunahsong.shinyapps.io/USNursingHomes/ .<h4>Conclusions</h4>Lack of resources and infrastructure contributes to challenges facing nursing homes as they develop antibiotic stewardship programs. Our experience with using pharmacy invoice data may serve as a useful approach for nursing homes to track and report antibiotic use.","Cleveland Institute for Computational Biology, Cleveland, OH, USA."

33401309,ADeditome provides the genomic landscape of A-to-I RNA editing in Alzheimer's disease. ,"A-to-I RNA editing, contributing to nearly 90% of all editing events in human, has been reported to involve in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) due to its roles in brain development and immune regulation, such as the deficient editing of GluA2 Q/R related to cell death and memory loss. Currently, there are urgent needs for the systematic annotations of A-to-I RNA editing events in AD. Here, we built ADeditome, the annotation database of A-to-I RNA editing in AD available at https://ccsm.uth.edu/ADeditome, aiming to provide a resource and reference for functional annotation of A-to-I RNA editing in AD to identify therapeutically targetable genes in an individual. We detected 1676 363 editing sites in 1524 samples across nine brain regions from ROSMAP, MayoRNAseq and MSBB. For these editing events, we performed multiple functional annotations including identification of specific and disease stage associated editing events and the influence of editing events on gene expression, protein recoding, alternative splicing and miRNA regulation for all the genes, especially for AD-related genes in order to explore the pathology of AD. Combing all the analysis results, we found 108 010 and 26 168 editing events which may promote or inhibit AD progression, respectively. We also found 5582 brain region-specific editing events with potentially dual roles in AD across different brain regions. ADeditome will be a unique resource for AD and drug research communities to identify therapeutically targetable editing events. Significance: ADeditome is the first comprehensive resource of the functional genomics of individual A-to-I RNA editing events in AD, which will be useful for many researchers in the fields of AD pathology, precision medicine, and therapeutic researches.","School of Life Science and Technology, Xidian University, Xi'an, China."

33968730,The Immune-Related Gene HCST as a Novel Biomarker for the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common type of kidney tumor worldwide. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases showed that the immune-related gene (IRG) hematopoietic cell signal transducer (HCST) could provide guidance for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of ccRCC. The RNA-seq data of ccRCC tissues were extracted from two databases: TCGA (https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/ccg/research/structural-genomics/tcga) and GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Corresponding clinical information was downloaded from TCGA. Immune-related gene data were extracted from the IMMPORT website (https://www.immport.org/). Differential analysis with R software (https://www.r-project.org/) was used to obtain a prognosis model of ccRCC IRGs. The differences were combined with the clinical data to assess the usefulness of the HCST as a prognostic biomarker. Based on data obtained from the Oncomine (https://www.oncomine.org/), Human Protein Atlas (https://www.proteinatlas.org/), and PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) databases, the expression levels of the HCST in ccRCC, clinical-pathological indicators of relevance, and influence on prognosis were analyzed. Regulation of the HCST gene in ccRCC was assessed by gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). In TCGA/GEO databases, the high HCST expression in tumor tissues was significantly correlated to the TMN stage, tumor grade, invasion depth, and lymphatic metastasis (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The overall survival (OS) of patients with high HCST gene expression was significantly lower than that of patients with low HCST gene expression (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested that the HCST expression level [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.630, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.042-2.552], tumor cell grade (HR = 1.829, 95% CI = 1.115-3.001), and distant metastasis (HR = 2.634, 95%, CI = 1.562-4.442) were independent risk factors affecting the OS of ccRCC patients (all, <i>p</i> < 0.05). The GSEA study showed that there was significant enrichment in cell adhesion, tumorigenesis, and immune and inflammatory responses in HCST high expression samples. Hematopoietic cell signal transducer expression was closely associated with the levels of infiltrating immune cells around ccRCC tissues, especially dendritic cells (DCs). In conclusion, the present study suggested that the HCST was interrelated to the clinicopathology and poor prognosis of ccRCC. High HCST expression was also closely correlated with the levels of tumor-infiltrating immune cells, especially DCs.","Department of Urology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China."
33942461,The hop downy mildew pathogen Pseudoperonospora humuli.,"Pseudoperonospora humuli is an obligate biotrophic oomycete that causes downy mildew, one of the most devastating diseases of cultivated hop, Humulus lupulus. Downy mildew occurs in all production areas of the crop in the Northern Hemisphere and Argentina. The pathogen overwinters in hop crowns and roots, and causes considerable crop loss. Downy mildew is managed by sanitation practices, planting of resistant cultivars, and fungicide applications. However, the scarcity of sources of host resistance and fungicide resistance in pathogen populations complicates disease management. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the symptoms of the disease, life cycle, virulence factors, and management of hop downy mildew, including various forecasting systems available in the world. Additionally, recent developments in genomics and effector discovery, and the future prospects of using such resources in successful disease management are also discussed.<h4>Taxonomy</h4>Class: Oomycota; Order: Peronosporales; Family: Peronosporaceae; Genus: Pseudoperonospora; Species: Pseudoperonospora humuli.<h4>Disease symptoms</h4>The disease is characterized by systemically infected chlorotic shoots called ""spikes"". Leaf symptoms and signs include angular chlorotic lesions and profuse sporulation on the abaxial side of the leaf. Under severe disease pressure, dark brown discolouration or lesions are observed on cones. Infected crowns have brown to black streaks when cut open. Cultivars highly susceptible to crown rot may die at this phase of the disease cycle without producing shoots. However, foliar symptoms may not be present on plants with systemically infected root systems.<h4>Infection process</h4>Pathogen mycelium overwinters in buds and crowns, and emerges on infected shoots in spring. Profuse sporulation occurs on infected tissues and sporangia are released and dispersed by air currents. Under favourable conditions, sporangia germinate and produce biflagellate zoospores that infect healthy tissue, thus perpetuating the infection cycle. Though oospores are produced in infected tissues, their role in the infection cycle is not defined.<h4>Control</h4>Downy mildew on hop is managed by a combination of sanitation practices and timely fungicide applications. Forecasting systems are used to time fungicide applications for successful management of the disease.

32696292,TLPdb: A Resource for Thaumatin-Like Proteins.,"Antifungal proteins and peptides have drawn the attention of numerous plant biologists and Clinicians, owing to their potential value in protecting commercial crops as well as preventing fungal infections in humans. Various proteins and peptides, such as glucanases, chitinases, chitinase-like proteins, lectins, peroxidases, defensins, and lipid transfer proteins have antifungal activities. Thaumatin is a protein from a West African plant Thaumatococcus danielli that is sweet in taste but does not exhibit antifungal activities. Despite the structural similarities between thaumatins and thaumatin-like proteins (TLPs), TLPs are not sweet in taste, unlike thaumatins. We developed a thaumatin-like protein database of various organisms. TLPs are pathogenesis-related proteins (PR) with molecular masses of 20-26 kDa. The amino acid residues of TLPs involved in an antifungal activity remain obscure and make it hard to receive comprehensive information on TLPs. The biggest problem in the wine industry is white haze, an undesirable feature of high-quality wine. Hence, the problem may be figured out with the easy accessibility of amino acid sequences and to generate infest resistant crops. Overall, we aimed to produce a freely accessible TLP database ( https://tlpdb.cftri.com ) that would provide substantive information in understanding the mechanistic facet of TLPs. Briefly, TLPdb contains sequences, structures, and amino acid compositions of validated, published TLP protein sequences (from the plant, fungal as well as animal sources). Thus, this work may yield valuable information that may be useful in understanding the mechanistic aspects of TLP activity and in the evolution of antifungal proteins and fungal resistant crops. TLPdb is a comprehensive thaumatin-like protein resource database of various organisms. The database can serve as a unique Bioinformatics tool for understanding the TLPs.

34122523,Development and Validation of a Hypoxia-Related Signature for Predicting Survival Outcomes in Patients With Bladder Cancer.,"<h4>Objectives</h4>This study aimed to develop and validate a hypoxia signature for predicting survival outcomes in patients with bladder cancer.<h4>Methods</h4>We downloaded the RNA sequence and the clinicopathologic data of the patients with bladder cancer from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/repository?facetTab=files) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) databases. Hypoxia genes were retrieved from the Molecular Signatures Database (https://www.gsea-msigdb.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp). Differentially expressed hypoxia-related genes were screened by univariate Cox regression analysis and Lasso regression analysis. Then, the selected genes constituted the hypoxia signature and were included in multivariate Cox regression to generate the risk scores. After that, we evaluate the predictive performance of this signature by multiple receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The CIBERSORT tool was applied to investigate the relationship between the hypoxia signature and the immune cell infiltration, and the maftool was used to summarize and analyze the mutational data. Gene-set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to investigate the related signaling pathways of differentially expressed genes in both risk groups. Furthermore, we developed a model and presented it with a nomogram to predict survival outcomes in patients with bladder cancer.<h4>Results</h4>Eight genes (AKAP12, ALDOB, CASP6, DTNA, HS3ST1, JUN, KDELR3, and STC1) were included in the hypoxia signature. The patients with higher risk scores showed worse overall survival time than the ones with lower risk scores in the training set (TCGA) and two external validation sets (GSE13507 and GSE32548). Immune infiltration analysis showed that two types of immune cells (M0 and M1 macrophages) had a significant infiltration in the high-risk group. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) analysis showed that the risk scores between the wild types and the mutation types of TP53, MUC16, RB1, and FGFR3 were significantly different. Gene-Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed that immune or cancer-associated pathways belonged to the high-risk groups and metabolism-related signal pathways were enriched into the low-risk group. Finally, we constructed a predictive model with risk score, age, and stage and validated its performance in GEO datasets.<h4>Conclusion</h4>We successfully constructed and validated a novel hypoxia signature in bladder cancer, which could accurately predict patients' prognosis.","Department of Urology, West China Hospital, Institute of Urology, Sichuan University, Chengdu, China."

These analytical advancements have facilitated the characterization of glycans associated with the follicle-stimulating hormones (FSH), which play a central role in the human reproductive system both in males and females utilizing regulating gonadal (testicular and ovarian) functions. The irregularities in FSH activity are also directly linked with osteoporosis. The glycoanalytical studies have been tremendously helpful in understanding the biological roles of FSH. Subsequently, the increasing number of characterized FSH glycan structures and related glycoform data has thrown a challenge to the glycoinformatics community in terms of data organization, storage and access. Also, a user-friendly platform is needed for providing easy access to the database and performing integrated analysis using a high volume of experimental data to accelerate FSH-focused research. FSH Glycans DataBase (FGDB) serves as a comprehensive and unique repository of structures, features, and related information of glycans associated with FSH. Apart from providing multiple search options, the database also facilitates an integrated user-friendly interface to perform the glycan abundance and comparative analyses using experimental data. The automated integrated pipelines present the possible structures of glycans and variants of FSH based on the input data, and allow the user to perform various analyses. The potential application of FGDB will significantly help both glycoinformaticians as well as wet-lab researchers to stimulate the research in this area.

33342295,Markedness and implicational relationships in phonological development: A cross-linguistic investigation.,"<h4>Purpose</h4>The complexity approach to speech disorders, based on the theoretical notion of phonological markedness, has been gaining interest over the last decade. In a nutshell, this approach suggests that the acquisition of phonologically marked units (e.g. complex onsets) implies the acquisition of less marked ones (e.g. singleton onsets). However, because the notion of markedness is, itself, subject to controversies, we need to constrain what types of implications can be generalised among language learners, within and across languages.<h4>Method</h4>We report on longitudinal data from one phonologically-disordered and five typically-developing children documented across four different languages (English, French, German, Portuguese), using data from the PhonBank database (https://phonbank.talkbank.org). Using the Phon software program (https://www.phon.ca), we systematically analysed each longitudinal study for consonants in singleton onsets and codas as well as in onset clusters.<h4>Result</h4>The implicational relationships supported by our study involve units of similar types (e.g. relations between different segmental categories), while relationships that involve different types of units or processes cannot be generalised across learners.<h4>Conclusion</h4>A better understanding of implicational relationships makes the complexity approach more predictive of developmental patterns of phonology and related phonological disorders.","Therapy, Child Development Centre of Prince George and District, Prince George, Canada, and."

34316700,On the impact of batch effect correction in TCGA isomiR expression data.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs with diverse functions in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Sequence and length variants of miRNAs are called isomiRs and can exert different functions compared to their canonical counterparts. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) provides isomiR-level expression data for patients of various cancer entities collected in a multi-center approach over several years. However, the impact of batch effects within individual cohorts has not been systematically investigated and corrected for before. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify relevant cohort-specific batch variables and generate batch-corrected isomiR expression data for 16 TCGA cohorts. The main batch variables included sequencing platform, plate, sample purity and sequencing depth. Platform bias was related to certain length and sequence features of individual recurrently affected isomiRs. Furthermore, significant downregulation of reported tumor suppressive isomiRs in lung tumor tissue compared to normal samples was only observed after batch correction, highlighting the importance of working with corrected data. Batch-corrected datasets for all cohorts including quality control are provided as supplement. In summary, this study reveals that batch effects present in the TCGA dataset might mask biologically relevant effects and provides a valuable resource for research on isomiRs in cancer (accessible through GEO: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE164767).","Division of Applied Bioinformatics, German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ), Berliner Straße 41, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany."

The database also includes binarized images of manually segmented microvascular networks associated with each raw image. The participant demographic characteristics, health status, and social habits information such as age, sex, body mass index, smoking history, alcohol use, as well as previous medical history was collected. As proof of the concept, a smaller set of 10 color digital fundus images from healthy older participants is also included. Comparison of the microvascular parameters of these two sets of images demonstrate that digital fundus images recorded with a hand-held portable camera are able to capture the changes in patterns of microvascular network associated with aging. The raw images from the TREND database provide a standard that defines normal retinal anatomy and microvascular network geometry in young healthy people in Montenegro as it is seen with the digital hand-held portable non-mydriatic MiiS HORUS Scope DEC 200.This knowledge could facilitate the application of this technology at the primary level of health care for large scale telematic screening for complications of chronic diseases, such as hypertensive and diabetic retinopathy. In addition, it could aid in the development of new methods for early detection of age-related changes in the retina, systemic chronic diseases, as well as eye-specific diseases.

33769951,A Comprehensive Map of mRNAs and Their Isoforms across All 14 Renal Tubule Segments of Mouse. ,"The repertoire of protein expression along the renal tubule depends both on regulation of transcription and regulation of alternative splicing that can generate multiple proteins from a single gene. A full-length, small-sample RNA-seq protocol profiled transcriptomes for all 14 renal tubule segments microdissected from mouse kidneys. This study identified >34,000 transcripts, including 3709 that were expressed in a segment-specific manner. All data are provided as an online resource (https://esbl.nhlbi.nih.gov/MRECA/Nephron/). Many of the genes expressed in unique patterns along the renal tubule were solute carriers, transcription factors, or G protein-coupled receptors that account for segment-specific function. Mapping the distribution of transcripts associated with Wnk-SPAK-PKA signaling, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone signaling, and cystic diseases of the kidney illustrated the applications of the online resource. The method allowed full-length mapping of RNA-seq reads, which facilitated comprehensive, unbiased characterization of alternative exon usage along the renal tubule, including known isoforms of Cldn10, Kcnj1 (ROMK), Slc12a1 (NKCC2), Wnk1, Stk39 (SPAK), and Slc14a2 (UT-A urea transporter). It also identified many novel isoforms with segment-specific distribution. These included variants associated with altered protein structure (Slc9a8, Khk, Tsc22d1, and Scoc), and variants that may affect untranslated, regulatory regions of transcripts (Pth1r, Pkar1a, and Dab2). Full-length, unbiased sequencing of transcripts identified gene-expression patterns along the mouse renal tubule. The data, provided as an online resource, include both quantitative and qualitative differences in transcripts.

The interaction data of each type are essential for drug metabolism, and the collective consideration of multiple types has implication for the future practice of precision medicine. However, no database was designed to systematically provide the data of all types of DME interactions. Here, a database of the Interactome of Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes (INTEDE) was therefore constructed to offer these interaction data.

34004273,Klebsiella MALDI TypeR: a web-based tool for Klebsiella identification based on MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry.,"Klebsiella pathogens affect human and animal health and are widely distributed in the environment. Among these, the Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex, which includes seven phylogroups, is an important cause of community and hospital infections. The Klebsiella oxytoca species complex also causes hospital infections and antibiotic-associated haemorrhagic colitis. The unsuitability of currently used clinical microbiology methods to distinguish species within each of these species complexes leads to high rates of misidentifications that are masking the true clinical significance and potential epidemiological specificities of individual species. We developed a web-based tool, Klebsiella MALDI TypeR, a platform-independent and user-friendly application that enables uploading MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry data in order to identify Klebsiella isolates at the species complex and phylogroup levels.

32920000,Safety assessment of drug combinations used in COVID-19 treatment: in silico toxicogenomic data-mining approach.,"Improvement of COVID-19 clinical condition was seen in studies where combination of antiretroviral drugs, lopinavir and ritonavir, as well as immunomodulant antimalaric, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine together with the macrolide-type antibiotic, azithromycin, was used for patient's treatment. Although these drugs are ""old"", their pharmacological and toxicological profile in SARS-CoV-2 - infected patients are still unknown. Thus, by using in silico toxicogenomic data-mining approach, we aimed to assess both risks and benefits of the COVID-19 treatment with the most promising candidate drugs combinations: lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin. The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD; http://CTD.mdibl.org), Cytoscape software (https://cytoscape.org) and ToppGene Suite portal (https://toppgene.cchmc.org) served as a foundation in our research. Our results have demonstrated that lopinavir/ritonavir increased the expression of the genes involved in immune response and lipid metabolism (IL6, ICAM1, CCL2, TNF, APOA1, etc.). Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin interacted with 6 genes (CCL2, CTSB, CXCL8, IL1B, IL6 and TNF), whereas chloroquine and azithromycin affected two additional genes (BCL2L1 and CYP3A4), which might be a reason behind a greater number of consequential diseases. In contrast to lopinavir/ritonavir, chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin downregulated the expression of TNF and IL6. As expected, inflammation, cardiotoxicity, and dyslipidaemias were revealed as the main risks of lopinavir/ritonavir treatment, while chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin therapy was additionally linked to gastrointestinal and skin diseases. According to our results, these drug combinations should be administrated with caution to patients suffering from cardiovascular problems, autoimmune diseases, or acquired and hereditary lipid disorders.","Department of Toxicology ""Akademik Danilo Soldatović"", Center for Toxicological Risk Assessment, University of Belgrade - Faculty of Pharmacy, Serbia.

32493955,WilsonGen a comprehensive clinically annotated genomic variant resource for Wilson's Disease.,"Wilson disease (WD) is one of the most prevalent genetic diseases with an estimated global carrier frequency of 1 in 90 and a prevalence of 1 in 30,000. The disease owes its genesis to Kinnier Wilson who described the disease, and is caused by accumulation of Copper (Cu) in various organs including the liver, central nervous system, cornea, kidney, joints and cardiac muscle which contribute to the characteristic clinical features of WD. A number of studies have reported genetic variants in the ATP7B gene from diverse ethnic and geographical origins. The recent advent of next-generation sequencing approaches has also enabled the discovery of a large number of novel variants in the gene associated with the disease. Previous attempts have been made to compile the knowledgebase and spectrum of genetic variants from across the multitude of publications, but have been limited by the utility due to the significant differences in approaches used to qualify pathogenicity of variants in each of the publications. The recent formulation of guidelines and algorithms for assessment of the pathogenicity of variants jointly put forward by the American College of Medical Genetics and the Association of Molecular Pathologists (ACMG &AMP) has provided a framework for evidence based and systematic assessment of pathogenicity of variants. In this paper, we describe a comprehensive resource of genetic variants in ATP7B gene manually curated from literature and data resources and systematically annotated using the ACMG & AMP guidelines for assessing pathogenicity. The resource therefore serves as a central point for clinicians and geneticists working on WD and to the best of our knowledge is the most comprehensive and only clinically annotated resource for WD. The resource is available at URL http://clingen.igib.res.in/WilsonGen/. We compiled a total of 3662 genetic variants from publications and databases associated with WD. Of these variants compiled, a total of 1458 were found to be unique entries. This is the largest WD database comprising 656 pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants reported classified according to ACMG & AMP guidelines. We also mapped all the pathogenic variants corresponding to ATP7B protein from literature and other databases. In addition, geographical origin and distribution of ATP7B pathogenic variants reported are also mapped in the database.","CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Mathura Road, Delhi, 110 025, India."

34142845,"First report of Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris as the causal agent of necrotic leaf spot in Phaseolus vulgaris at Puebla, Mexico. ","Beans are the most cultivated legume in the world. In Mexico, it is the second most important crop after corn (FAO 2020; SIAP 2020). Bean plants ""Flor de Mayo M38"" variety were affected by a foliar disease during the agricultural cycle 2019 in Puebla-Mexico (19°02'46.6"" LN and 98°05'15.6"" LO). Necrotic V- shaped lesions were observed on the margins of the leaves surrounded by yellow halos followed by foliar necrosis, affecting 40% of the crop. In Mexico this variety of cultivars is in great demand for local consumption and generates income in foreign currency (Castellanos et al. 1997). Sampling was carried out on 50 plants ""Flor de Mayo M38"" variety, with necrotic leaf symptoms from ten plots of one hectare. Samples were cut into pieces (5 mm), disinfested with 1% hypochlorite 3 min, and washed with sterile distilled water. Subsequently, samples were dried on sterile paper and placed on Petri plates containing yeast extract calcium carbonate dextrose agar (YDC) medium and kept at 36°C for 3 days. Colonies of ten typical bacteria isolated from all symptomatic plants were Gram (-), small and uniform in size with rounded edges, yellow, convex with entire borders and mucoid appearance on YDC. Bacteria did not grow on 0.1% triphenyl tetrazolium chloride amended casamino acid, peptone, and glucose medium (CPG). Biochemical tests showed that isolates did not reduce nitrate to nitrites, had positive catalase and starch hydrolysis, while the Kovac oxidase test was negative (Schaad and White 1974). Genus identity of the representative isolate Xcf1-APJR, was confirmed by 16S rRNA encoding gene partial sequencing, using universal primers 518F (5'-CCAGCAGCCGCGGTAATACG-3') and 800R (5'-TACCAGGGTATCTAATCC-3') (Halim et al. 2020). BLASTn alignments against the nucleotide collection were 100% identical to Xanthomonas sequences including Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris strains NZ_AP019684.1, CP025750.1, and MN108237.1. The 1,418 bp sequence was deposited in the GenBank database under accession number MT645246. The identification of species/pathovar was accomplished by serological methods using a polyclonal antiserum specific for X. campestris pv. campestris (Popovic ́ et al. 2013) with the DAS-ELISA commercial kit (catalog number 07122C/096, LOEWE Biochemica GmbH, Germany). The pathogenicity test was carried out on 50 healthy bean plants from the ""Flor de Mayo M38"" variety. Bacterial culture incubated at 28°C for 48 h in YDC medium was used to prepare the bacterial suspension (108 CFU mL-1). The first two lower leaves of 30-day-old plants were inoculated by sprinkling. Ten plants sprayed with sterile distilled water were used as negative control. All plants were kept for 20 days in greenhouse at 18-26°C and relative humidity of 60%. After seven days, chlorotic lesions developed on all inoculated plants that became necrotic from 14 days after inoculation (dai). Necrotic leaf spots merged at 14 dai to form necrotic areas of more than 20 mm in diameter, reaching total necrosis of the leaf tissue at 20 dai and were similar to the symptoms observed in the field. Koch's postulates were confirmed by the reisolation of Xcf1-APJR strain, which presented the same colony morphology, partial sequence, and polyclonal specific detection. This is the first report of this pathogen causing necrotic leaf spot in beans from the ""Flor de Mayo M38"" variety in Puebla-Mexico. The author(s) declare no conflict of interest.

We now report PSORTdb 4.0 (http://db.psort.org/). It features a website refresh, in particular a more user-friendly database search. It also addresses the need to uniquely identify proteins from NCBI genomes now that GI numbers have been retired. It further expands both ePSORTdb and cPSORTdb, including additional data about novel secondary localizations, such as proteins found in bacterial outer membrane vesicles. Protein predictions in cPSORTdb have increased along with the number of available microbial genomes, from approximately 13 million when PSORTdb 3.0 was released, to over 66 million currently. Now, analyses of both complete and draft genomes are included. This expanded database will be of wide use to researchers developing SCL predictors or studying diverse microbes, including medically, agriculturally and industrially important species that have both classic or atypical cell envelope structures or vesicles.","Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia V5A 1S6, Canada."
31642484,SilkDB 3.0: visualizing and exploring multiple levels of data for silkworm.,"SilkDB is an open-accessibility database and powerful platform that provides comprehensive information on the silkworm (Bombyx mori) genome. Since SilkDB 2.0 was released 10 years ago, vast quantities of data about multiple aspects of the silkworm have been generated, including genome, transcriptome, Hi-C and pangenome. To visualize data at these different biological levels, we present SilkDB 3.0 (https://silkdb.bioinfotoolkits.net), a visual analytic tool for exploring silkworm data through an interactive user interface. The database contains a high-quality chromosome-level assembly of the silkworm genome, and its coding sequences and gene sets are more accurate than those in the previous version. SilkDB 3.0 provides a view of the information for each gene at the levels of sequence, protein structure, gene family, orthology, synteny, genome organization and gives access to gene expression information, genetic variation and genome interaction map.

33539888,PPD: A Manually Curated Database for Experimentally Verified Prokaryotic Promoters.,"As a key region, promoter plays a key role in transcription regulation. A eukaryotic promoter database called EPD has been constructed to store eukaryotic POL II promoters. Although there are some promoter databases for specific prokaryotic species or specific promoter type, such as RegulonDB for Escherichia coli K-12, DBTBS for Bacillus subtilis and Pro54DB for sigma 54 promoter, because of the diversity of prokaryotes and the development of sequencing technology, huge amounts of prokaryotic promoters are scattered in numerous published articles, which is inconvenient for researchers to explore the process of gene regulation in prokaryotes. In this study, we constructed a Prokaryotic Promoter Database (PPD), which records the experimentally validated promoters in prokaryotes, from published articles. Up to now, PPD has stored 129,148 promoters across 63 prokaryotic species manually extracted from published papers. We provided a friendly interface for users to browse, search, blast, visualize, submit and download data. The PPD will provide relatively comprehensive resources of prokaryotic promoter for the study of prokaryotic gene transcription.

33294866,Pancreatlas: Applying an Adaptable Framework to Map the Human Pancreas in Health and Disease.,"Human tissue phenotyping generates complex spatial information from numerous imaging modalities, yet images typically become static figures for publication, and original data and metadata are rarely available. While comprehensive image maps exist for some organs, most resources have limited support for multiplexed imaging or have non-intuitive user interfaces. Therefore, we built a Pancreatlas resource that integrates several technologies into a unique interface, allowing users to access richly annotated web pages, drill down to individual images, and deeply explore data online. The current version of Pancreatlas contains over 800 unique images acquired by whole-slide scanning, confocal microscopy, and imaging mass cytometry, and is available at https://www.pancreatlas.org. To create this human pancreas-specific biological imaging resource, we developed a React-based web application and Python-based application programming interface, collectively called Flexible Framework for Integrating and Navigating Data (FFIND), which can be adapted beyond Pancreatlas to meet countless imaging or other structured data-management needs.","Division of Diabetes, Endocrinology, and Metabolism, Department of Medicine, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, USA."

In order to understand the biology of SARS-CoV-2 and developing drug against COVID-19, a vast amount of genomic, proteomic, interatomic, and clinical data is being generated, and the bioinformatics researchers produced databases, webservers and tools to gather those publicly available data and provide an opportunity of analyzing such data. However, these bioinformatics resources are scattered and researchers need to find them from different resources discretely. To facilitate researchers in finding the resources in one frame, we have developed an integrated web portal called OverCOVID (http://bis.zju.edu.cn/overcovid/). The publicly available webservers, databases and tools associated with SARS-CoV-2 have been incorporated in the resource page. In addition, a network view of the resources is provided to display the scope of the research.

33331653,DATAMAN: A global database of nitrous oxide and ammonia emission factors for excreta deposited by livestock and land-applied manure.,"Nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub> O), ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub> ), and methane (CH<sub>4</sub> ) emissions from the manure management chain of livestock production systems are important contributors to greenhouse gases (GHGs) and NH<sub>3</sub> emitted by human activities. Several studies have evaluated manure-related emissions and associated key variables at regional, national, or continental scales. However, there have been few studies focusing on the drivers of these emissions using a global dataset. An international project was created (DATAMAN) to develop a global database on GHG and NH<sub>3</sub> emissions from the manure management chain (housing, storage, and field) to identify key variables influencing emissions and ultimately to refine emission factors (EFs) for future national GHG inventories and NH<sub>3</sub> emission reporting. This paper describes the ""field"" database that focuses on N<sub>2</sub> O and NH<sub>3</sub> EFs from land-applied manure and excreta deposited by grazing livestock. We collated relevant information (EFs, manure characteristics, soil properties, and climatic conditions) from published peer-reviewed research, conference papers, and existing databases. The database, containing 5,632 observations compiled from 184 studies, was relatively evenly split between N<sub>2</sub> O and NH<sub>3</sub> (56 and 44% of the EF values, respectively). The N<sub>2</sub> O data were derived from studies conducted in 21 countries on five continents, with New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Kenya, and Brazil representing 86% of the data. The NH<sub>3</sub> data originated from studies conducted in 17 countries on four continents, with the United Kingdom, Denmark, Canada, and The Netherlands representing 79% of the data. Wet temperate climates represented 90% of the total database.

In genomics and transcriptomics, the sharing of raw data from next-generation sequencers is made possible through public repositories. In addition, in proteomics, the deposition of raw data from mass spectrometry (MS) experiments into repositories is becoming standardized. However, a standard repository for such MS data had not yet been established in glycomics. With the increasing number of glycomics MS data, therefore, we have developed GlycoPOST (https://glycopost.glycosmos.org/), a repository for raw MS data generated from glycomics experiments. In just the first year since the release of GlycoPOST, 73 projects have already been registered by researchers around the world, and the number of registered projects is continuously growing, making a significant contribution to the future FAIRness of the glycomics field.

In recent years, researchers have generated a large number of high-throughput sequencing data in <i>P. trichocarpa</i>. However, no comprehensive database that provides multi-omics associations for the investigation of secondary growth in response to diverse stresses has been reported. Therefore, we developed a public repository that presents comprehensive measurements of gene expression and post-transcriptional regulation by integrating 144 RNA-Seq, 33 ChIP-seq, and six single-molecule real-time (SMRT) isoform sequencing (Iso-seq) libraries prepared from tissues subjected to different stresses. All the samples from different studies were analyzed to obtain gene expression, co-expression network, and differentially expressed genes (DEG) using unified parameters, which allowed comparison of results from different studies and treatments. In addition to gene expression, we also identified and deposited pre-processed data about alternative splicing (AS), alternative polyadenylation (APA) and alternative transcription initiation (ATI).

33676930,The DBSAV Database: Predicting Deleteriousness of Single Amino Acid Variations in the Human Proteome.,"Deleterious single amino acid variation (SAV) is one of the leading causes of human diseases. Evaluating the functional impact of SAVs is crucial for diagnosis of genetic disorders. We previously developed a deep convolutional neural network predictor, DeepSAV, to evaluate the deleterious effects of SAVs on protein function based on various sequence, structural, and functional properties. DeepSAV scores of rare SAVs observed in the human population are aggregated into a gene-level score called GTS (Gene Tolerance of rare SAVs) that reflects a gene's tolerance to deleterious missense mutations and serves as a useful tool to study gene-disease associations. In this study, we aim to enhance the performance of DeepSAV by using expanded datasets of pathogenic and benign variants, more features, and neural network optimization. We found that multiple sequence alignments built from vertebrate-level orthologs yield better prediction results compared to those built from mammalian-level orthologs. For multiple sequence alignments built from BLAST searches, optimal performance was achieved with a sequence identify cutoff of 50% to remove distant homologs. The new version of DeepSAV exhibits the best performance among standalone predictors of deleterious effects of SAVs. We developed the DBSAV database (http://prodata.swmed.edu/DBSAV) that reports GTS scores of human genes and DeepSAV scores of SAVs in the human proteome, including pathogenic and benign SAVs, population-level SAVs, and all possible SAVs by single nucleotide variations.

32508104,Scop3P: A Comprehensive Resource of Human Phosphosites within Their Full Context.,"Protein phosphorylation is a key post-translational modification in many biological processes and is associated to human diseases such as cancer and metabolic disorders. The accurate identification, annotation, and functional analysis of phosphosites are therefore crucial to understand their various roles. Phosphosites are mainly analyzed through phosphoproteomics, which has led to increasing amounts of publicly available phosphoproteomics data. Several resources have been built around the resulting phosphosite information, but these are usually restricted to the protein sequence and basic site metadata. What is often missing from these resources, however, is context, including protein structure mapping, experimental provenance information, and biophysical predictions. We therefore developed Scop3P: a comprehensive database of human phosphosites within their full context. Scop3P integrates sequences (UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot), structures (PDB), and uniformly reprocessed phosphoproteomics data (PRIDE) to annotate all known human phosphosites.

A growing number of variants and genes have been reported to be associated with PD; however, there is no database that integrate different type of genetic data, and support analyzing of PD-associated genes (PAGs). By systematic review and curation of multiple lines of public studies, we integrate multiple layers of genetic data (rare variants and copy-number variants identified from patients with PD, associated variants identified from genome-wide association studies, differentially expressed genes, and differential DNA methylation genes) and age at onset in PD. We integrated five layers of genetic data (8302 terms) with different levels of evidences from more than 3,000 studies and prioritized 124 PAGs with strong or suggestive evidences. These PAGs were identified to be significantly interacted with each other and formed an interconnected functional network enriched in several functional pathways involved in PD, suggesting these genes may contribute to the pathogenesis of PD. Furthermore, we identified 10 genes were associated with a juvenile-onset (age ≤ 30 years), 11 genes were associated with an early-onset (age of 30-50 years), whereas another 10 genes were associated with a late-onset (age > 50 years). Notably, the AAOs of patients with loss of function variants in five genes were significantly lower than that of patients with deleterious missense variants, while patients with <i>VPS13C</i> (<i>P</i> = 0.01) was opposite. Finally, we developed an online database named Gene4PD (http://genemed.tech/gene4pd) which integrated published genetic data in PD, the PAGs, and 63 popular genomic data sources, as well as an online pipeline for prioritize risk variants in PD.

33750297,Rust expression browser: an open source database for simultaneous analysis of host and pathogen gene expression profiles with expVIP.,"<h4>Background</h4>Transcriptomics is being increasingly applied to generate new insight into the interactions between plants and their pathogens. For the wheat yellow (stripe) rust pathogen (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, Pst) RNA-based sequencing (RNA-Seq) has proved particularly valuable, overcoming the barriers associated with its obligate biotrophic nature. This includes the application of RNA-Seq approaches to study Pst and wheat gene expression dynamics over time and the Pst population composition through the use of a novel RNA-Seq based surveillance approach called ""field pathogenomics"". As a dual RNA-Seq approach, the field pathogenomics technique also provides gene expression data from the host, giving new insight into host responses. However, this has created a wealth of data for interrogation.<h4>Results</h4>Here, we used the field pathogenomics approach to generate 538 new RNA-Seq datasets from Pst-infected field wheat samples, doubling the amount of transcriptomics data available for this important pathosystem. We then analysed these datasets alongside 66 RNA-Seq datasets from four Pst infection time-courses and 420 Pst-infected plant field and laboratory samples that were publicly available. A database of gene expression values for Pst and wheat was generated for each of these 1024 RNA-Seq datasets and incorporated into the development of the rust expression browser ( http://www.rust-expression.com ). This enables for the first time simultaneous 'point-and-click' access to gene expression profiles for Pst and its wheat host and represents the largest database of processed RNA-Seq datasets available for any of the three Puccinia wheat rust pathogens. We also demonstrated the utility of the browser through investigation of expression of putative Pst virulence genes over time and examined the host plants response to Pst infection.<h4>Conclusions</h4>The rust expression browser offers immense value to the wider community, facilitating data sharing and transparency and the underlying database can be continually expanded as more datasets become publicly available.","John Innes Centre, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, NR4 7UH, UK."
32487193,SCDb: an integrated database of stomach cancer.,"<h4>Background</h4>Stomach cancer (SC) is a type of cancer, which is derived from the stomach mucous membrane. As there are non-specific symptoms or no noticeable symptoms observed at the early stage, newly diagnosed SC cases usually reach an advanced stage and are thus difficult to cure. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to develop an integrated database of SC.<h4>Methods</h4>SC-related genes were identified through literature mining and by analyzing the publicly available microarray datasets. Using the RNA-seq, miRNA-seq and clinical data downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves for all the SC-related genes were generated and analyzed. The miRNAs (miRanda, miRTarget2, PicTar, PITA and TargetScan databases), SC-related miRNAs (HMDD and miR2Disease databases), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, dbSNP database), and SC-related SNPs (ClinVar database) were also retrieved from the indicated databases. Moreover, gene_disease (OMIM and GAD databases), copy number variation (CNV, DGV database), methylation (PubMeth database), drug (WebGestalt database), and transcription factor (TF, TRANSFAC database) analyses were performed for the differentially expressed genes (DEGs).<h4>Results</h4>In total, 9990 SC-related genes (including 8347 up-regulated genes and 1643 down-regulated genes) were identified, among which, 65 genes were further confirmed as SC-related genes by performing enrichment analysis. Besides this, 457 miRNAs, 20 SC-related miRNAs, 1570 SNPs, 108 SC-related SNPs, 419 TFs, 44,605 CNVs, 3404 drug-associated genes, 63 genes with methylation, and KM survival curves of 20,264 genes were obtained. By integrating these datasets, an integrated database of stomach cancer, designated as SCDb, (available at http://www.stomachcancerdb.org/) was established.<h4>Conclusions</h4>As a comprehensive resource for human SC, SCDb database will be very useful for performing SC-related research in future, and will thus promote the understanding of the pathogenesis of SC.","Department of Gastroenterology, Jing'An District Centre Hospital of Shanghai (Huashan Hospital Fudan University Jing'An Branch), Shanghai, 200040, People's Republic of China."
33175872,High density genotype storage for plant breeding in the Chado schema of Breedbase.,"Modern breeding programs routinely use genome-wide information for selecting individuals to advance. The large volumes of genotypic information required present a challenge for data storage and query efficiency. Major use cases require genotyping data to be linked with trait phenotyping data. In contrast to phenotyping data that are often stored in relational database schemas, next-generation genotyping data are traditionally stored in non-relational storage systems due to their extremely large scope. This study presents a novel data model implemented in Breedbase (https://breedbase.org/) for uniting relational phenotyping data and non-relational genotyping data within the open-source PostgreSQL database engine. Breedbase is an open-source, web-database designed to manage all of a breeder's informatics needs: management of field experiments, phenotypic and genotypic data collection and storage, and statistical analyses. The genotyping data is stored in a PostgreSQL data-type known as binary JavaScript Object Notation (JSONb), where the JSON structures closely follow the Variant Call Format (VCF) data model. The Breedbase genotyping data model can handle different ploidy levels, structural variants, and any genotype encoded in VCF. JSONb is both compressed and indexed, resulting in a space and time efficient system. Furthermore, file caching maximizes data retrieval performance. Integration of all breeding data within the Chado database schema retains referential integrity that may be lost when genotyping and phenotyping data are stored in separate systems. Benchmarking demonstrates that the system is fast enough for computation of a genomic relationship matrix (GRM) and genome wide association study (GWAS) for datasets involving 1,325 diploid Zea mays, 314 triploid Musa acuminata, and 924 diploid Manihot esculenta samples genotyped with 955,690, 142,119, and 287,952 genotype-by-sequencing (GBS) markers, respectively.","Plant Breeding and Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, United States of America."
33125079,Cyanorak v2.1: a scalable information system dedicated to the visualization and expert curation of marine and brackish picocyanobacteria genomes.,"Cyanorak v2.1 (http://www.sb-roscoff.fr/cyanorak) is an information system dedicated to visualizing, comparing and curating the genomes of Prochlorococcus, Synechococcus and Cyanobium, the most abundant photosynthetic microorganisms on Earth. The database encompasses sequences from 97 genomes, covering most of the wide genetic diversity known so far within these groups, and which were split into 25,834 clusters of likely orthologous groups (CLOGs). The user interface gives access to genomic characteristics, accession numbers as well as an interactive map showing strain isolation sites. The main entry to the database is through search for a term (gene name, product, etc.), resulting in a list of CLOGs and individual genes. Each CLOG benefits from a rich functional annotation including EggNOG, EC/K numbers, GO terms, TIGR Roles, custom-designed Cyanorak Roles as well as several protein motif predictions. Cyanorak also displays a phyletic profile, indicating the genotype and pigment type for each CLOG, and a genome viewer (Jbrowse) to visualize additional data on each genome such as predicted operons, genomic islands or transcriptomic data, when available. This information system also includes a BLAST search tool, comparative genomic context as well as various data export options. Altogether, Cyanorak v2.1 constitutes an invaluable, scalable tool for comparative genomics of ecologically relevant marine microorganisms.","Sorbonne Université & CNRS, UMR 7144 'Adaptation & Diversity in the Marine Environment' (AD2M), Station Biologique de Roscoff (SBR), 29680 Roscoff, France."

33465550,In-silico identification of subunit vaccine candidates against lung cancer-associated oncogenic viruses.,"Globally, ~20% of cancer malignancies are associated with virus infections. Lung cancer is the most prevalent cancer and has a 10% 5-year survival rate when diagnosed at stage IV. Cancer vaccines and oncolytic immunotherapy are promising treatment strategies for better clinical outcomes in advanced-stage cancer patients. Here, we used a reverse vaccinology approach to devise subunit vaccine candidates against lung cancer-causing oncogenic viruses. Protein components (945) from nine oncogenic virus species were systematically analyzed to identify epitope-based subunit vaccine candidates. Best vaccine candidates were identified based on their predicted ability to stimulate humoral and cell-mediated immunity and avoid self-tolerance. Using a rigorous integrative approach, we identified 125 best antigenic epitopes with predicted B-cell, T-cell, and/or MHC-binding capability and vaccine adjuvant potential. Thirty-two of these antigenic epitopes were predicted to have IL-4/IFN-gamma inducing potential and IL-10 non-inducing potential and were predicted to bind 15 MHC-type I and 49 MHC-type II alleles. All 32 epitopes were non-allergenic and 31 were non-toxic. The identified epitopes showed good conservancy and likely bind a broad class of human HLA alleles, indicating promiscuous potential. The majority of best antigenic epitopes were derived from Human papillomavirus and Epstein-Barr virus proteins. Of the 32 epitopes, 25 promiscuous epitopes were related to E1 and E6 envelope genes and were present in multiple viral strains/species, potentially providing heterologous immunity. Further validating our results, 38 antigenic epitopes were also present in the largest experimentally-validated epitope resource, Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource. We further narrowed the selection to 29 antigenic epitopes with the highest immunogenic/immune-boosting potential. These epitopes possess tremendous therapeutic potential as vaccines against lung cancer-causing viruses and should be validated in future experiments.

33655207,TMSNP: a web server to predict pathogenesis of missense mutations in the transmembrane region of membrane proteins.,"The massive amount of data generated from genome sequencing brings tons of newly identified mutations, whose pathogenic/non-pathogenic effects need to be evaluated. This has given rise to several mutation predictor tools that, in general, do not consider the specificities of the various protein groups. We aimed to develop a predictor tool dedicated to membrane proteins, under the premise that their specific structural features and environment would give different responses to mutations compared to globular proteins. For this purpose, we created TMSNP, a database that currently contains information from 2624 pathogenic and 196 705 non-pathogenic reported mutations located in the transmembrane region of membrane proteins. By computing various conservation parameters on these mutations in combination with annotations, we trained a machine-learning model able to classify mutations as pathogenic or not. TMSNP (freely available at http://lmc.uab.es/tmsnp/) improves considerably the prediction power of commonly used mutation predictors trained with globular proteins.","Laboratori de Medicina Computacional, Facultat de Medicina, Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, 08193 Bellaterra, Spain."
31452162,Accessing Cryptosporidium Omic and Isolate Data via CryptoDB.org.,"Cryptosporidium has historically been a difficult organism to work with, and molecular genomic data for this important pathogen have typically lagged behind other prominent protist pathogens. CryptoDB ( http://cryptodb.org/ ) was launched in 2004 following the appearance of draft genome sequences for both C. parvum and C. hominis. CryptoDB merged with the EuPathDB Bioinformatics Resource Center family of databases ( https://eupathdb.org ) and has been maintained and updated regularly since its establishment. These resources are freely available, are web-based, and permit users to analyze their own sequence data in the context of reference genome sequences in our user workspaces.

Thus, it can provide an important resource for discovering candidate genes/factors involved in tolerance to these stresses. Here, we report a draft genome assembly of 573 Mb comprised of 8877 scaffolds with N50 length of 205 kb. We predicted a total of 50,562 protein-coding genes, of which a significant fraction was found to be involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis and hormone signal transduction pathways. Several salinity and submergence stress-responsive protein-coding and long noncoding RNAs involved in diverse biological processes were identified using RNA-sequencing data. Based on small RNA sequencing, we identified 168 unique miRNAs and 3219 target transcripts (coding and noncoding) involved in several biological processes, including abiotic stress responses. Further, whole genome bisulphite sequencing data analysis revealed at least 19%-48% methylcytosines in different sequence contexts and the influence of methylation status on gene expression. The genome assembly along with other datasets have been made publicly available at http://ccbb.jnu.ac.in/ory-coar.

33787284,Consensus Transcriptional Landscape of Human End-Stage Heart Failure.,"Background Transcriptomic studies have contributed to fundamental knowledge of myocardial remodeling in human heart failure (HF). However, the key HF genes reported are often inconsistent between studies, and systematic efforts to integrate evidence from multiple patient cohorts are lacking. Here, we aimed to provide a framework for comprehensive comparison and analysis of publicly available data sets resulting in an unbiased consensus transcriptional signature of human end-stage HF. Methods and Results We curated and uniformly processed 16 public transcriptomic studies of left ventricular samples from 263 healthy and 653 failing human hearts. First, we evaluated the degree of consistency between studies by using linear classifiers and overrepresentation analysis. Then, we meta-analyzed the deregulation of 14 041 genes to extract a consensus signature of HF. Finally, to functionally characterize this signature, we estimated the activities of 343 transcription factors, 14 signaling pathways, and 182 micro RNAs, as well as the enrichment of 5998 biological processes. Machine learning approaches revealed conserved disease patterns across all studies independent of technical differences. These consistent molecular changes were prioritized with a meta-analysis, functionally characterized and validated on external data. We provide all results in a free public resource (https://saezlab.shinyapps.io/reheat/) and exemplified usage by deciphering fetal gene reprogramming and tracing the potential myocardial origin of the plasma proteome markers in patients with HF. Conclusions Even though technical and sampling variability confound the identification of differentially expressed genes in individual studies, we demonstrated that coordinated molecular responses during end-stage HF are conserved. The presented resource is crucial to complement findings in independent studies and decipher fundamental changes in failing myocardium.","Faculty of Medicine, and Heidelberg University Hospital Institute for Computational Biomedicine Bioquant Heidelberg University Heidelberg Germany."

32592631,"A study on the structure, mechanism, and biochemistry of kanamycin B dioxygenase (KanJ)-an enzyme with a broad range of substrates.","Kanamycin A is an aminoglycoside antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces kanamyceticus and used against a wide spectrum of bacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Biosynthesis of kanamycin involves an oxidative deamination step catalyzed by kanamycin B dioxygenase (KanJ), thereby the C2' position of kanamycin B is transformed into a keto group upon release of ammonia. Here, we present for the first time, structural models of KanJ with several ligands, which along with the results of ITC binding assays and HPLC activity tests explain substrate specificity of the enzyme. The large size of the binding pocket suggests that KanJ can accept a broad range of substrates, which was confirmed by activity tests. Specificity of the enzyme with respect to its substrate is determined by the hydrogen bond interactions between the methylamino group of the antibiotic and highly conserved Asp134 and Cys150 as well as between hydroxyl groups of the substrate and Asn120 and Gln80. Upon antibiotic binding, the C terminus loop is significantly rearranged and Gln80 and Asn120, which are directly involved in substrate recognition, change their conformations. Based on reaction energy profiles obtained by density functional theory (DFT) simulations, we propose a mechanism of ketone formation involving the reactive Fe<sup>IV</sup>  = O and proceeding either via OH rebound, which yields a hemiaminal intermediate or by abstraction of two hydrogen atoms, which leads to an imine species. At acidic pH, the latter involves a lower barrier than the OH rebound, whereas at basic pH, the barrier leading to an imine vanishes completely.

34038437,Genome-wide comparative analyses of GATA transcription factors among 19 Arabidopsis ecotype genomes: Intraspecific characteristics of GATA transcription factors.,"GATA transcription factors (TFs) are widespread eukaryotic regulators whose DNA-binding domain is a class IV zinc finger motif (CX2CX17-20CX2C) followed by a basic region. Due to the low cost of genome sequencing, multiple strains of specific species have been sequenced: e.g., number of plant genomes in the Plant Genome Database (http://www.plantgenome.info/) is 2,174 originated from 713 plant species. Thus, we investigated GATA TFs of 19 Arabidopsis thaliana genome-widely to understand intraspecific features of Arabidopsis GATA TFs with the pipeline of GATA database (http://gata.genefamily.info/). Numbers of GATA genes and GATA TFs of each A. thaliana genome range from 29 to 30 and from 39 to 42, respectively. Four cases of different pattern of alternative splicing forms of GATA genes among 19 A. thaliana genomes are identified. 22 of 2,195 amino acids (1.002%) from the alignment of GATA domain amino acid sequences display variations across 19 ecotype genomes. In addition, maximally four different amino acid sequences per each GATA domain identified in this study indicate that these position-specific amino acid variations may invoke intraspecific functional variations. Among 15 functionally characterized GATA genes, only five GATA genes display variations of amino acids across ecotypes of A. thaliana, implying variations of their biological roles across natural isolates of A. thaliana. PCA results from 28 characteristics of GATA genes display the four groups, same to those defined by the number of GATA genes. Topologies of bootstrapped phylogenetic trees of Arabidopsis chloroplasts and common GATA genes are mostly incongruent. Moreover, no relationship between geographical distribution and their phylogenetic relationships was found. Our results present that intraspecific variations of GATA TFs in A. thaliana are conserved and evolutionarily neutral along with 19 ecotypes, which is congruent to the fact that GATA TFs are one of the main regulators for controlling essential mechanisms, such as seed germination and hypocotyl elongation.","InfoBoss Inc., Gangnam-gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea."
34107016,VirusViz: comparative analysis and effective visualization of viral nucleotide and amino acid variants.,"Variant visualization plays an important role in supporting the viral evolution analysis, extremely valuable during the COVID-19 pandemic. VirusViz is a web-based application for comparing variants of selected viral populations and their sub-populations; it is primarily focused on SARS-CoV-2 variants, although the tool also supports other viral species (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Dengue, Ebola). As input, VirusViz imports results of queries extracting variants and metadata from the large database ViruSurf, which integrates information about most SARS-CoV-2 sequences publicly deposited worldwide. Moreover, VirusViz accepts sequences of new viral populations as multi-FASTA files plus corresponding metadata in CSV format; a bioinformatic pipeline builds a suitable input for VirusViz by extracting the nucleotide and amino acid variants. Pages of VirusViz provide metadata summarization, variant descriptions, and variant visualization with rich options for zooming, highlighting variants or regions of interest, and switching from nucleotides to amino acids; sequences can be grouped, groups can be comparatively analyzed. For SARS-CoV-2, we manually collect mutations with known or predicted levels of severity/virulence, as indicated in linked research articles; such critical mutations are reported when observed in sequences. The system includes light-weight project management for downloading, resuming, and merging data analysis sessions.

34197127,"Precise Evaluation of Spatial Characteristics of Periodically Precipitating Systems via Measurement of RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) Values of Pattern Images.","In the present study, a method is described for precise determination of spatial characteristics of Liesegang bands formed by employing a classical 1D setup using a web-based free resource (https://www.ginifab.com/feeds/pms/color_picker_from_image.php). The method involves the compartmentalization of the information on each pixel into R (red), G (green), or B (blue) values from the pattern images obtained using a simple digital camera. The values can further be converted to absorbance values by using the system blank. Each trough (or peak) in the graph of RGB values (or absorbance values) corresponds to a band in the pattern. The method is employed to determine the spacing and width of the periodically precipitating AgCl, AgBr, and Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> in an agar gel. It is observed that AgCl shows revert banding, and AgBr shows revert banding at the top of the tube and then diverges to regular banding at the bottom of the tube, whereas the Co(OH)<sub>2</sub> patterns explicitly show regular banding under given experimental conditions. It is also observed that minute instabilities, such as the formation of secondary bands, can also be visualized by the present method.","Post Graduate and Research Center, Department of Chemistry, S.

33999203,PredictProtein - Predicting Protein Structure and Function for 29 Years.,"Since 1992 PredictProtein (https://predictprotein.org) is a one-stop online resource for protein sequence analysis with its main site hosted at the Luxembourg Centre for Systems Biomedicine (LCSB) and queried monthly by over 3,000 users in 2020. PredictProtein was the first Internet server for protein predictions. It pioneered combining evolutionary information and machine learning. Given a protein sequence as input, the server outputs multiple sequence alignments, predictions of protein structure in 1D and 2D (secondary structure, solvent accessibility, transmembrane segments, disordered regions, protein flexibility, and disulfide bridges) and predictions of protein function (functional effects of sequence variation or point mutations, Gene Ontology (GO) terms, subcellular localization, and protein-, RNA-, and DNA binding). PredictProtein's infrastructure has moved to the LCSB increasing throughput; the use of MMseqs2 sequence search reduced runtime five-fold (apparently without lowering performance of prediction methods); user interface elements improved usability, and new prediction methods were added. PredictProtein recently included predictions from deep learning embeddings (GO and secondary structure) and a method for the prediction of proteins and residues binding DNA, RNA, or other proteins. PredictProtein.org aspires to provide reliable predictions to computational and experimental biologists alike. All scripts and methods are freely available for offline execution in high-throughput settings.","TUM (Technical University of Munich) Department of Informatics, Bioinformatics & Computational Biology - i12, Boltzmannstr 3, 85748 Garching/Munich, Germany."

Moonlighting proteins have two or more physiologically relevant distinct biochemical or biophysical functions performed by a single polypeptide chain. Here, we describe an expansion in the database since our previous report in the Database Issue of Nucleic Acids Research in 2018. For this release, the number of proteins annotated has been expanded to over 500 proteins and dozens of protein annotations have been updated with additional information, including more structures in the Protein Data Bank, compared with version 2.0. The new entries include more examples from humans, plants and archaea, more proteins involved in disease and proteins with different combinations of functions. More kinds of information about the proteins and the species in which they have multiple functions has been added, including CATH and SCOP classification of structure, known and predicted disorder, predicted transmembrane helices, type of organism, relationship of the protein to disease, and relationship of organism to cause of disease.","Department of Bioengineering, University of Illinois at Chicago, Chicago, IL 60607, USA."
33546584,Plant Co-expression Annotation Resource: a web server for identifying targets for genetically modified crop breeding pipelines.,"The development of genetically modified crops (GM) includes the discovery of candidate genes through bioinformatics analysis using genomics data, gene expression, and others. Proteins of unknown function (PUFs) are interesting targets for GM crops breeding pipelines for the novelty associated with such targets and also to avoid copyright protection. One method of inferring the putative function of PUFs is by relating them to factors of interest such as abiotic stresses using orthology and co-expression networks, in a guilt-by-association manner. In this regard, we have downloaded, analyzed, and processed genomics data of 53 angiosperms, totaling 1,862,010 genes and 2,332,974 RNA. Diamond and InterproScan were used to discover 72,266 PUFs for all organisms. RNA-seq datasets related to abiotic stresses were downloaded from NCBI/GEO. The RNA-seq data was used as input to the LSTrAP software to construct co-expression networks. LSTrAP also created clusters of transcripts with correlated expression, whose members are more probably related to the molecular mechanisms associated with abiotic stresses in the plants. Orthologous groups were created (OrhtoMCL) using all 2,332,974 proteins in order to associate PUFs to abiotic stress-related clusters of co-expression and therefore infer their function in a guilt-by-association manner. A freely available web resource named ""Plant Co-expression Annotation Resource"" ( https://www.machado.cnptia.embrapa.br/plantannot ), Plantannot, was created to provide indexed queries to search for PUF putatively associated with abiotic stresses. The web interface also allows browsing, querying, and retrieving of public genomics data from 53 plants. We hope Plantannot to be useful for researchers trying to obtain novel GM crops resistant to climate change hazards.","Graduate Program in Bioinformatics, Institute of Biological Sciences, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, 31270-901, Brazil."
32294193,ctcRbase: the gene expression database of circulating tumor cells and microemboli. ,"Circulating tumor cells/microemboli (CTCs/CTMs) are malignant cells that depart from cancerous lesions and shed into the bloodstream. Analysis of CTCs can allow the investigation of tumor cell biomarker expression from a non-invasive liquid biopsy. To date, high-throughput technologies have become a powerful tool to provide a genome-wide view of transcriptomic changes associated with CTCs/CTMs. These data provided us much information to understand the tumor heterogeneity, and the underlying molecular mechanism of tumor metastases. Unfortunately, these data have been deposited into various repositories, and a uniform resource for the cancer metastasis is still unavailable. To this end, we integrated previously published transcriptome datasets of CTCs/CTMs and constructed a web-accessible database. The first release of ctcRbase contains 526 CTCs/CTM samples across seven cancer types. The expression of 14 631 mRNAs and 3642 long non-coding RNAs of CTCs/CTMs were included. Experimental validations from the published literature are also included. Since CTCs/CTMs are considered to be precursors of metastases, ctcRbase also collected the expression data of primary tumors and metastases, which allows user to discover a unique 'circulating tumor cell gene signature' that is distinct from primary tumor and metastases. An easy-to-use database was constructed to query and browse CTCs/CTMs genes. ctcRbase can be freely accessible at http://www.origin-gene.cn/database/ctcRbase/.","Shanghai Key Laboratory of Regulatory Biology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, School of Life Sciences, East China Normal University, No.500 Dongchuan Road, Shanghai, 200241 China."
33765325,A Bayesian spatial model for imaging genetics. ,"We develop a Bayesian bivariate spatial model for multivariate regression analysis applicable to studies examining the influence of genetic variation on brain structure. Our model is motivated by an imaging genetics study of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), where the objective is to examine the association between images of volumetric and cortical thickness values summarizing the structure of the brain as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and a set of 486 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) from 33 Alzheimer's disease (AD) candidate genes obtained from 632 subjects. A bivariate spatial process model is developed to accommodate the correlation structures typically seen in structural brain imaging data. First, we allow for spatial correlation on a graph structure in the imaging phenotypes obtained from a neighborhood matrix for measures on the same hemisphere of the brain. Second, we allow for correlation in the same measures obtained from different hemispheres (left/right) of the brain. We develop a mean-field variational Bayes algorithm and a Gibbs sampling algorithm to fit the model. We also incorporate Bayesian false discovery rate (FDR) procedures to select SNPs. We implement the methodology in a new release of the R package bgsmtr. We show that the new spatial model demonstrates superior performance over a standard model in our application. Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the ADNI database (https://adni.loni.usc.edu).","Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada."

We demonstrate the reproducibility and stability of data from multiple sources and validate the SCLC consensus nomenclature on the basis of expression of master transcription factors NEUROD1, ASCL1, POU2F3, and YAP1. Our analyses reveal transcription networks linking SCLC subtypes with MYC and its paralogs and the NOTCH and HIPPO pathways. SCLC subsets express specific surface markers, providing potential opportunities for antibody-based targeted therapies. YAP1-driven SCLCs are notable for differential expression of the NOTCH pathway, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and antigen-presenting machinery (APM) genes and sensitivity to mTOR and AKT inhibitors. These analyses provide insights into SCLC biology and a framework for future investigations into subtype-specific SCLC vulnerabilities.","Developmental Therapeutics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."
